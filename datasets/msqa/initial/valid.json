    "context": "The Colorado Plateau , also known as the Colorado Plateau Province , is a physiographic and desert region of the Intermontane Plateaus , roughly centered on the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States . The province covers an area of 337,000 km ( 130,000 mi ) within western Colorado , northwestern New Mexico , southern and eastern Utah , and northern Arizona . About 90 % of the area is drained by the Colorado River and its main tributaries : the Green , San Juan , and Little Colorado . Most of the remainder of the plateau is drained by the Rio Grande and its tributaries . The Colorado Plateau is largely made up of high desert , with scattered areas of forests . In the southwest corner of the Colorado Plateau lies the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River . Much of the Plateau 's landscape is related , in both appearance and geologic history , to the Grand Canyon . The nickname `` Red Rock Country '' suggests the brightly colored rock left bare to the view by dryness and erosion . Domes , hoodoos , fins , reefs , river narrows , natural bridges , and slot canyons are only some of the additional features typical of the Plateau .",

    "context": "On 8 October 2014 , the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Eric Betzig , William Moerner and Stefan Hell for `` the development of super-resolved fluorescence microscopy , '' which brings `` optical microscopy into the nanodimension '' . There are two basic types of optical microscopes : simple microscopes and compound microscopes . A simple microscope is one which uses a single lens for magnification , such as a magnifying glass . A compound microscope uses several lenses to enhance the magnification of an object . The vast majority of modern research microscopes are compound microscopes while some cheaper commercial digital microscopes are simple single lens microscopes . Compound microscopes can be further divided into a variety of other types of microscopes which differ in their optical configurations , cost , and intended purposes . A simple microscope uses a lens or set of lenses to enlarge an object through angular magnification alone , giving the viewer an erect enlarged virtual image . The use of a single convex lens or groups of lenses are still found in simple magnification devices such as the magnifying glass , loupes , and eyepieces for telescopes and microscopes .",

    "question": "the 3 types of customers in the nps model",
    "context": "The Net Promoter Score is calculated based on responses to a single question : How likely is it that you would recommend our company / product / service to a friend or colleague ? The scoring for this answer is most often based on a 0 to 10 scale . Those who respond with a score of 9 to 10 are called Promoters , and are considered likely to exhibit value - creating behaviors , such as buying more , remaining customers for longer , and making more positive referrals to other potential customers . Those who respond with a score of 0 to 6 are labeled Detractors , and they are believed to be less likely to exhibit the value - creating behaviors . Responses of 7 and 8 are labeled Passives , and their behavior falls in the middle of Promoters and Detractors . The Net Promoter Score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of customers who are Detractors from the percentage of customers who are Promoters . For purposes of calculating a Net Promoter Score , Passives count towards the total number of respondents , thus decreasing the percentage of detractors and promoters and pushing the net score towards 0 . Companies are encouraged to follow the likelihood to recommend question with an open - ended request for elaboration , soliciting the reasons for a customer 's rating of that company or product . These reasons can then be provided to front - line employees and management teams for follow - up action . Local office branch managers at Charles Schwab Corporation , for example , call back customers to engage them in a discussion about the feedback they provided through the NPS survey process , solve problems , and learn more so they can coach account representatives .",

It is a talent show that features singers , dancers , magicians , comedians , and other performers of all ages competing for the advertised top prize of one million dollars . The show debuted in June 2006 for the summer television season . From season three ( 2008 ) onwards , the prize includes the one million dollars , payable in a financial annuity over 40 years , and a chance to headline a show on the Las Vegas Strip . Among its significant features is that it gives an opportunity to talented amateurs or unknown performers , with the results decided by an audience vote . The format is a popular one and has often been reworked for television in the United States and the United Kingdom . This incarnation was created by Simon Cowell , and was originally due to be a 2005 British series called Paul O'Grady 's Got Talent but was postponed due to O'Grady's acrimonious split with broadcaster ITV ( later launching as Britain 's Got Talent in 2007 ) .

    "question": "what trees do you get maple syrup from",
    "context": "Maple syrup is a syrup usually made from the xylem sap of sugar maple , red maple , or black maple trees , although it can also be made from other maple species . In cold climates , these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before winter ; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring . Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap , which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water , leaving the concentrated syrup . Maple syrup was first collected and used by the indigenous peoples of North America , and the practice was adopted by European settlers , who gradually refined production methods . Technological improvements in the 1970s further refined syrup processing . The Canadian province of Quebec is by far the largest producer , responsible for 70 percent of the world 's output ; Canadian exports of maple syrup in 2016 were C $ 487 million ( about US $ 360 million ) , with Quebec accounting for some 90 percent of this total . Vermont is the largest producer in the United States , generating about six percent of the global supply .",

    "context": "Operation Rolling Thunder was the title of a gradual and sustained aerial bombardment campaign conducted by the U.S. 2nd Air Division ( later Seventh Air Force ) , U.S. Navy , and Republic of Vietnam Air Force ( VNAF ) against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam ( North Vietnam ) from 2 March 1965 until 2 November 1968 , during the Vietnam War . The four objectives of the operation ( which evolved over time ) were to boost the sagging morale of the Saigon regime in the Republic of Vietnam , to persuade North Vietnam to cease its support for the communist insurgency in South Vietnam without actually taking any ground forces into communist North Vietnam , to destroy North Vietnam 's transportation system , industrial base , and air defenses , and to halt the flow of men and material into South Vietnam . Attainment of these objectives was made difficult by both the restraints imposed upon the U.S. and its allies by Cold War exigencies and by the military aid and assistance received by North Vietnam from its communist allies , the Soviet Union , the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) and North Korea . The operation became the most intense air / ground battle waged during the Cold War period ; it was the most difficult such campaign fought by the United States since the aerial bombardment of Germany during World War II . Supported by communist allies , North Vietnam fielded a potent mixture of sophisticated air - to - air and surface - to - air weapons that created one of the most effective air defenses ever faced by American military aviators .",

    "question": "which two hormones are known for their roles in the fight-or-flight response",
    "context": "The fight - or - flight response ( also called hyperarousal , or the acute stress response ) is a physiological reaction that occurs in response to a perceived harmful event , attack , or threat to survival . It was first described by Walter Bradford Cannon . His theory states that animals react to threats with a general discharge of the sympathetic nervous system , preparing the animal for fighting or fleeing . More specifically , the adrenal medulla produces a hormonal cascade that results in the secretion of catecholamines , especially norepinephrine and epinephrine . The hormones estrogen , testosterone , and cortisol , as well as the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin , also affect how organisms react to stress . This response is recognised as the first stage of the general adaptation syndrome that regulates stress responses among vertebrates and other organisms .",

    "question": "who made the engine for the p 51 mustang",
    "context": "The North American Aviation P - 51 Mustang is an American long - range , single - seat fighter and fighter - bomber used during World War II and the Korean War , among other conflicts . The Mustang was designed in 1940 by North American Aviation ( NAA ) in response to a requirement of the British Purchasing Commission . The Purchasing Commission approached North American Aviation to build Curtiss P - 40 fighters under license for the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . Rather than build an old design from another company , North American Aviation proposed the design and production of a more modern fighter . The prototype NA - 73X airframe was rolled out on 9 September 1940 , 102 days after the contract was signed , and first flew on 26 October . The Mustang was originally designed to use the Allison V - 1710 engine , which , in its earlier variants , had limited high - altitude performance . It was first flown operationally by the RAF as a tactical - reconnaissance aircraft and fighter - bomber ( Mustang Mk I ) . The replacement of the Allison with a Rolls - Royce Merlin resulted in the P - 51B / C ( Mustang Mk III ) model and transformed the Mustang 's performance at altitudes above 15,000 ft , allowing the aircraft to compete with the Luftwaffe 's fighters . The definitive version , the P - 51D , was powered by the Packard V - 1650 - 7 , a license - built version of the Rolls - Royce Merlin 66 two - stage two - speed supercharged engine and was armed with six . 50 caliber ( 12.7 mm ) M2 / AN Browning machine guns . From late 1943 , P - 51Bs and Cs ( supplemented by P - 51Ds from mid-1944 ) were used by the USAAF 's Eighth Air Force to escort bombers in raids over Germany , while the RAF 's Second Tactical Air Force and the USAAF 's Ninth Air Force used the Merlin - powered Mustangs as fighter - bombers , roles in which the Mustang helped ensure Allied air superiority in 1944 . The P - 51 was also used by Allied air forces in the North African , Mediterranean , Italian and Pacific theaters . During World War II , Mustang pilots claimed to have destroyed 4,950 enemy aircraft .",

    "question": "who played the first game on monday night football",
    "context": "The following article details the history of Monday Night Football , the weekly broadcast of National Football League games on U.S. television . During the early 1960s , NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle envisioned the possibility of playing at least one game weekly during prime time that could be viewed by a greater television audience ( while the NFL had scheduled Saturday night games on the DuMont Television Network in 1953 and 1954 , poor ratings and the dissolution of DuMont led to those games being eliminated by the time CBS took over the rights in 1956 ) . An early bid by the league in 1964 to play on Friday nights was soundly defeated , with critics charging that such telecasts would damage the attendance at high school football games . Undaunted , Rozelle decided to experiment with the concept of playing on Monday night , scheduling the Green Bay Packers and Detroit Lions for a game on September 28 , 1964 . While the game was not televised , it drew a sellout crowd of 59,203 spectators to Tiger Stadium , the largest crowd ever to watch a professional football game in Detroit up to that point . Two years later , Rozelle would build on this success as the NFL began a four - year experiment of playing on Monday night , scheduling one game in prime time on CBS during the 1966 and 1967 seasons , and two contests during each of the next two years . NBC followed suit in 1968 and 1969 with games involving American Football League teams .",

The game became established fairly quickly and grew very popular as the 20th century progressed , first in America and then throughout the world . After basketball became established in American colleges , the professional game followed . The American National Basketball Association ( NBA ) , established in 1946 , grew to a multibillion - dollar enterprise by the end of the century , and basketball became an integral part of American culture . The game of basketball as it is known today was created by Dr. James Naismith in December 1891 in Springfield , Massachusetts , to condition young athletes during cold months . It consisted of peach baskets and a soccer style ball . He published 13 rules for the new game . He divided his class of eighteen into two teams of nine players each and set about to teach them the basics of his new game . The objective of the game was to throw the basketball into the fruit baskets nailed to the lower railing of the gym balcony . Every time a point was scored , the game was halted so the janitor could bring out a ladder and retrieve the ball . After a while , the bottoms of the fruit baskets were removed . The first public basketball game was played in Springfield , Massachusetts , on March 11 , 1892 .",

Weissman wore prosthetics to resemble Glover and imitated Glover 's rendering of McFly , and his scenes were spliced with shots of Glover from Back to the Future . The result was so convincing that many people were fooled by it . Glover did not appreciate this , and sued . The lawsuit resulted in the adoption of stricter rules by the Screen Actors Guild to prevent this situation from occurring again . Lorraine Baines - McFly ( portrayed by Lea Thompson and voiced by Aimee Miles in Back to the Future : The Game ) is the wife of George McFly and the mother of Marty , Linda and Dave . She is the eldest daughter of Sam ( George DiCenzo ) and Stella ( Frances Lee McCain ) Baines , and sister of Milton ( Jason Hervey ) , Sally ( Maia Brewton ) , Toby , and Joey . In Back to the Future , Lorraine is initially portrayed in 1985 as middle - aged and unhappy . After Marty changes the timeline , she is shown to be fit and happily married to George in 1985 .

Howie Newsome is delivering milk in the pouring rain while Si Crowell , younger brother of Joe , laments how George 's baseball talents will be squandered . George pays an awkward visit to his soon - to - be in - laws . Here , the Stage Manager interrupts the scene and takes the audience back a year , to the end of Emily and George 's junior year . Emily confronts George about his pride , and over an ice cream soda , they discuss the future and their love for each other . George resolves not to go to college , as he had planned , but to work and eventually take over his uncle 's farm . In the present , George and Emily say that they are not ready to marry -- George to his mother , Emily to her father -- but they both calm down and happily go through with the wedding . Nine years have passed . The Stage Manager opens the act with a lengthy monologue emphasizing eternity , bringing the audience 's attention to the cemetery outside of town and the characters who have died since the wedding , including Mrs. Gibbs ( pneumonia , while traveling ) , Wally Webb ( burst appendix , while camping ) , Mrs. Soames , and Simon Stimson ( suicide by hanging ) . Town undertaker Joe Stoddard is introduced , as is a young man named Sam Craig who has returned to Grover 's Corners for his cousin 's funeral . That cousin is Emily , who died giving birth to her and George 's second child . Once the funeral ends , Emily emerges to join the dead ; Mrs. Gibbs urges her to forget her life , warning her that being able to see but not interact with her family , all the while knowing what will happen in the future , will cause her too much pain , but she refuses . Ignoring the warnings of Simon , Mrs. Soames , and Mrs. Gibbs , Emily returns to Earth to relive one day , her 12th birthday . Emily watches with joy at being able to see her parents and some of the people of her childhood for the first time in years . However , her joy quickly turns to pain as she realizes how little people appreciate the simple joys of life . The memory proves too painful for her , and she realizes that every moment of life should be treasured . When she asks the Stage Manager if anyone truly understands the value of life while they live it , he responds , `` No . The saints and poets , maybe -- they do some . '' Emily returns to her grave next to Mrs. Gibbs and watches impassively as George kneels weeping over her . The Stage Manager concludes the play and wishes the audience a good night .",

    "question": "what lands did france give up as a result of the french and indian war",
    "context": "The British colonial government fell in the region of modern Nova Scotia after several disastrous campaigns in 1757 , including a failed expedition against Louisbourg and the Siege of Fort William Henry ; this last was followed by Indians torturing and massacring their British victims . William Pitt came to power and significantly increased British military resources in the colonies at a time when France was unwilling to risk large convoys to aid the limited forces that they had in New France , preferring to concentrate their forces against Prussia and its allies in the European theater of the war . Between 1758 and 1760 , the British military launched a campaign to capture the Colony of Canada ( part of New France ) . They succeeded in capturing territory in surrounding colonies and ultimately the city of Quebec ( 1759 ) . The British later lost the Battle of Sainte - Foy west of Quebec ( 1760 ) , but the French ceded Canada in accordance with the Treaty of Paris ( 1763 ) . The outcome was one of the most significant developments in a century of Anglo - French conflict . France ceded to Great Britain its territory east of the Mississippi . It ceded French Louisiana west of the Mississippi River ( including New Orleans ) to its ally Spain in compensation for Spain 's loss to Britain of Florida . ( Spain had ceded Florida to Britain in exchange for the return of Havana , Cuba . ) France 's colonial presence north of the Caribbean was reduced to the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon , confirming Great Britain 's position as the dominant colonial power in eastern North America . The conflict is known by multiple names . In British America , wars were often named after the sitting British monarch , such as King William 's War or Queen Anne 's War . There had already been a King George 's War in the 1740s during the reign of King George II , so British colonists named this conflict after their opponents , and it became known as the French and Indian War . This traditional name continues as the standard in the United States , but it obscures the fact that Indians fought on both sides of the conflict and that this was part of the Seven Years ' War , a much larger conflict between France and Great Britain . American historians generally use the traditional name or sometimes the Seven Years ' War . Less frequently used names for the war include the Fourth Intercolonial War and the Great War for the Empire .",

The market encompasses the EU 's 28 member states , and has been extended , with exceptions , to Iceland , Liechtenstein and Norway through the Agreement on the European Economic Area and to Switzerland through bilateral treaties . The market is intended to be conducive to increased competition , increased specialisation , larger economies of scale , allowing goods and factors of production to move to the area where they are most valued , thus improving the efficiency of the allocation of resources . It is also intended to drive economic integration whereby the once separate economies of the member states become integrated within a single EU - wide economy . Half of the trade in goods within the EU is covered by legislation harmonised by the EU . The creation of the internal market as a seamless , single market is an ongoing process , with the integration of the service industry still containing gaps .

He is named after the singer of the same name . He apparently suffered from epileptic fits when he was smaller , although this has never been seen . It was also implied that he used to wet the bed , though he claims that it was only to help put out the fires , which he had a fondness for starting , as seen during his pyromania phase in series 4 - 5 - matchboxes and lighter - fluid were routinely found under his mattress by his brothers Carl ( Elliott Tittensor ) and Ian ( Gerard Kearns ) . Throughout the series , Liam is practically raised by his older sisters , Fiona ( Anne - Marie Duff ) and Debbie ( Rebecca Ryan ) , as his father Frank ( David Threlfall ) is lazy and mother Monica ( Annabelle Apsion ) inept - when she is around . In later episodes , Liam shows considerable intelligence and resourcefulness like sister Debbie and is also an outspoken atheist . In series 5 , signs of genius in Liam became obvious when he was shown to be an adept car thief , much like Steve McBride ( James McAvoy ) , and was seen later to use a defibrillator on a comatose Frank when it was thought that his heart had stopped . In series 6 , it is revealed that Liam is a talented musician , and also fluent in Sign Language . Given his academic performance , the school determines Liam to be an exceptionally gifted pupil , which leads to him being awarded a special scholarship . During an interview at a local university , he initially fails to make a good impression due to nervousness . But that changed when his father Frank attempts to steal the `` Joy of Sex '' manual from the university library ; Liam plucks up the courage to tell the panel of education directors why he deserves the scholarship in an impassioned speech . Liam appeared in 78 episodes in total . Liam was also persuaded by his brother Carl to create false identities on the internet for him , Chesney Karib ( Qasim Akhtar ) , Maxine Donnelly ( Joanna Higson ) , and Micky Maguire ( Ciarán Griffiths ) , so they would be admitted into an exclusive nightclub .",

It connects the systems of superior vena cava and inferior vena cava and can provide an alternative path for blood to the right atrium when either of the venae cavae is blocked .

In some rare variations for example , it also drains thoracic veins , bronchial veins and even gonadal veins . The vein is so named because it has no symmetrically equivalent vein on the left side of the body . It is formed by the union of the ascending lumbar veins with the right subcostal veins at the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra , ascending in the posterior mediastinum , and arching over the right main bronchus posteriorly at the root of the right lung to join the superior vena cava . This `` arch of the azygos vein '' ( arcus venae azygos ) is an important anatomic landmark . As an anatomical variation in 1 - 2 % of the population , the arch can be displaced laterally , thereby creating a pleural septum separating an azygos lobe from the upper lobe of the right lung .",

In the human the female reproductive system is immature at birth and develops to maturity at puberty to be able to produce gametes , and to carry a fetus to full term . The internal sex organs are the uterus , Fallopian tubes , and ovaries . The uterus or womb accommodates the embryo which develops into the fetus . The uterus also produces vaginal and uterine secretions which help the transit of sperm to the Fallopian tubes . The ovaries produce the ova ( egg cells ) . The external sex organs are also known as the genitals and these are the organs of the vulva including the labia , clitoris , and vaginal opening . The vagina is connected to the uterus at the cervix . At certain intervals , the ovaries release an ovum , which passes through the Fallopian tube into the uterus .

    "question": "who bombed the bridge over the river kwai",
    "context": "In an interview made by former POW John Coast , which formed a part of the BBC2 documentary Return to the River Kwai in 1969 , Boulle outlined the reasoning which led him to conceive the movie character of Lt. Col ' . Nicholson , who in the film works to build the fictional bridge and ultimately tries to prevent its destruction by Allied troops . A transcript of the interview and the documentary as a whole can be found in the new edition of John Coast 's book , Railroad of Death . The first wooden railroad bridge over the Khwae Yai was finished in February 1943 , which was soon accompanied by a more - modern concrete - and - steel railroad bridge ( made up of eleven curved - truss bridge spans which the Japanese builders brought over from Java in the Dutch East Indies in 1942 , which by then was under Japanese occupation , as was much of Southeast Asia ; this is also the bridge that still remains to this day and has become iconic around the world ) in June 1943 , with both running in a NNE -- SSW direction across the river . It was this Bridge 277 that was meant to be attacked with the help of one of the world 's first examples of a precision - guided munition , which was the American VB - 1 AZON MCLOS - guided 1,000 lb aerial ordnance on 23 January 1945 but bad weather prompted the cancellation of the mission and the AZON was never deployed against the bridge . According to Thai - based Hellfire Tours , the `` two bridges were successfully bombed and damaged on 13 February of 1945 by bomber aircraft from the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . Repairs were carried out by forced labour of POWs shortly after and by April the wooden railroad trestle bridge was back in operation . On 3 April a second bombing raid , this time by Liberator heavy bombers of the U.S. Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) , damaged the wooden railroad bridge once again . Repair work soon commenced afterwards and continued again and both bridges were operational again by the end of May . A second air - raid by the RAF on 24 June finally severely damaged and destroyed the railroad bridges and put the entire railway line out of commission for the rest of the war until the Japanese surrender in August . After Japan 's capitulation , the British Army removed about 3.9 kilometers of the original Japanese railroad track on the Thai -- Burma border . A survey of the track had shown that its poor construction would not support commercial railroad traffic . The recovered tracks were subsequently sold to Thai Railways and the 130 km Ban Pong -- Nam Tok section of railway was relaid and is still in use up to today . '' The new railway line did not fully connect with the Burmese railroad network as no railroad bridges were built which crossed the river between Moulmein Martaban ( the former on the river 's southern bank and the latter to the opposite on the northern bank ) . Thus , ferries were needed as an alternative connecting system . A bridge was not built until the Thanlwin Bridge ( carrying both regular road and railroad traffic ) was constructed between 2000 and 2005 .",

Earth 's internal heat powers most geological processes and drives plate tectonics . Despite its geological significance , this heat energy coming from Earth 's interior is actually only 0.03 % of Earth 's total energy budget at the surface , which is dominated by 173,000 TW of incoming solar radiation . The insolation that eventually , after reflection , reaches the surface penetrates only several tens of centimeters on the daily cycle and only several tens of meters on the annual cycle .

    "question": "where did the names of the magi come from",
    "context": "The wise men are mentioned twice shortly thereafter in verse 16 , in reference to their avoidance of Herod after seeing Jesus , and what Herod had learned from their earlier meeting . The star which they followed has traditionally become known as the Star of Bethlehem . The Magi are popularly referred to as wise men and kings . The word magi is the plural of Latin magus , borrowed from Greek μάγος magos , as used in the original Greek text of the Gospel of Matthew ( `` μάγοι '' ) . Greek magos itself is derived from Old Persian maguŝ from the Avestan magâunô , i.e. , the religious caste into which Zoroaster was born ( see Yasna 33.7 : `` ýâ sruyê parê magâunô '' = `` so I can be heard beyond Magi '' ) . The term refers to the Persian priestly caste of Zoroastrianism . As part of their religion , these priests paid particular attention to the stars and gained an international reputation for astrology , which was at that time highly regarded as a science . Their religious practices and use of astrology caused derivatives of the term Magi to be applied to the occult in general and led to the English term magic , although Zoroastrianism was in fact strongly opposed to sorcery . The King James Version translates the term as wise men ; the same translation is applied to the wise men led by Daniel of earlier Hebrew Scriptures ( Daniel 2 : 48 ) . The same word is given as sorcerer and sorcery when describing `` Elymas the sorcerer '' in Acts 13 : 6 -- 11 , and Simon Magus , considered a heretic by the early Church , in Acts 8 : 9 -- 13 . Several translations refer to the men outright as astrologers at Matthew Chapter 2 , including New English Bible ( 1961 ) ; Phillips New Testament in Modern English ( J.B. Phillips , 1972 ) ; Twentieth Century New Testament ( 1904 revised edition ) ; Amplified Bible ( 1958 - New Testament ) ; An American Translation ( 1935 , Goodspeed ) ; and The Living Bible ( K. Taylor , 1962 - New Testament ) . Although the Magi are commonly referred to as `` kings , '' there is nothing in the account from the Gospel of Matthew that implies that they were rulers of any kind . The identification of the Magi as kings is linked to Old Testament prophecies that describe the Messiah being worshipped by kings in Isaiah 60 : 3 , Psalm 68 : 29 , and Psalm 72 : 10 , which reads , `` Yea , all kings shall fall down before him : all nations serve him . '' Early readers reinterpreted Matthew in light of these prophecies and elevated the Magi to kings . By AD 500 all commentators adopted the prevalent tradition that the three were kings . Later Christian interpretation stressed the Adorations of the Magi and shepherds as the first recognition by the people of the earth of Christ as the Redeemer , but the reformer John Calvin was vehemently opposed to referring to the Magi as kings . He once wrote : `` But the most ridiculous contrivance of the Papists on this subject is , that those men were kings ... Beyond all doubt , they have been stupefied by a righteous judgment of God , that all might laugh at ( their ) gross ignorance . ''",

    "question": "which country was soviet union enemy during the cold war",
    "context": "The Cold War was a state of geopolitical tension after World War II between powers in the Eastern Bloc ( the Soviet Union and its satellite states ) and powers in the Western Bloc ( the United States , its NATO allies and others ) . Historians do not fully agree on the dates , but a common timeframe is the period between 1947 , the year the Truman Doctrine , a U.S. foreign policy pledging to aid nations threatened by Soviet expansionism , was announced , and either 1989 , when communism fell in Eastern Europe , or 1991 , when the Soviet Union collapsed . The term `` cold '' is used because there was no large - scale fighting directly between the two sides , but they each supported major regional wars known as proxy wars . The Cold War split the temporary wartime alliance against Nazi Germany , leaving the Soviet Union and the United States as two superpowers with profound economic and political differences . The USSR was a Marxist -- Leninist state led by its Communist Party , which in turn was dominated by a leader with different titles over time , and a small committee called the Politburo . The Party controlled the press , the military , the economy and many organizations . It also controlled the other states in the Eastern Bloc , and funded Communist parties around the world , sometimes in competition with Communist China , particularly following the Sino - Soviet split of the 1960s . In opposition stood the capitalist West , led by the United States , a federal republic with a two - party presidential system . The First World nations of the Western Bloc were generally liberal democratic with a free press and independent organizations , but were economically and politically entwined with a network of banana republics and other authoritarian regimes throughout the Third World , most of which were the Western Bloc 's former colonies . Some major Cold War frontlines such as Vietnam , Indonesia , and the Congo were still Western colonies in 1947 .",

    "context": "The Rhine ( Latin : Rhenus , Romansh : Rein , German : Rhein , French : le Rhin , Dutch : Rijn ) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps , forms part of the Swiss - Austrian , Swiss - Liechtenstein , Swiss - German and then the Franco - German border , then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands . The largest city on the river Rhine is Cologne , Germany , with a population of more than 1,050,000 people . It is the second - longest river in Central and Western Europe ( after the Danube ) , at about 1,230 km ( 760 mi ) , with an average discharge of about 2,900 m / s ( 100,000 cu ft / s ) . The Rhine and the Danube formed most of the northern inland frontier of the Roman Empire and , since those days , the Rhine has been a vital and navigable waterway carrying trade and goods deep inland . Its importance as a waterway in the Holy Roman Empire is supported by the many castles and fortifications built along it . In the modern era , it has become a symbol of German nationalism .",

    "question": "how was rudolph the red nosed reindeer made",
    "context": "The TV special , with the teleplay by Romeo Muller , introduced several new characters inspired by the song 's lyrics . Muller told an interviewer shortly before his death that he would have preferred to base the teleplay on May 's original book , but could not find a copy . Other than Burl Ives , all characters were portrayed by Canadian actors recorded at RCA studios in Toronto under the supervision of Bernard Cowan . After the script , concept designs and storyboards for Rudolph were done by Arthur Rankin , Jr. and his staff of artists at Rankin / Bass in New York City , the company 's trademark stop motion animation process , known as `` Animagic '' , was filmed at MOM Productions in Tokyo with supervision by Tadahito Mochinaga and associate direction by Kizo Nagashima . Besides Rudolph , Mochinaga and the rest of the Japanese puppet animation staff are also known for their partnership with Rankin / Bass on their other `` Animagic '' productions almost throughout the 1960s , from The New Adventures of Pinocchio , to Willy McBean and his Magic Machine , to The Daydreamer and Mad Monster Party ? . Since those involved with the production had no idea of the future value of the stop - motion puppet figures used in the production , many were not preserved . Rankin claimed in 2007 to be in possession of an original Rudolph figure . Nine other puppets -- including Santa and young Rudolph -- were given to a secretary , who gave them to family members . Eventually seven were discarded . In 2005 , the remaining two puppets of Rudolph and Santa were appraised on Antiques Roadshow ; the episode aired in 2006 on PBS . At that time , their appraised value was between $8,000 and $10,000 . The puppets had been damaged through years of rough handling by children and storage in an attic . Toy aficionado Kevin Kriess bought Santa and Rudolph in 2005 ; in 2007 , he had both puppets restored by Screen Novelties , a Los Angeles - based collective of film directors specializing in stop motion animation with puppet fabricator Robin Walsh leading the project . The figures have been shown at conventions since then .",

    "context": "Depp also said in an Entertainment Weekly article that he `` imagine ( d ) this guy wore really cheesy tourist shirts '' , that he had a `` sideline obsession with Broadway '' , and that he favored strange , obvious disguises -- all three qualities can be observed in the film . It was also revealed in the director 's commentary on the DVD that Depp himself came up with the character 's first and middle names . Made on a US $29 million budget , the film was shot in May 2001 before Spy Kids 2 : The Island of Lost Dreams ( 2002 ) and Spy Kids 3 - D : Game Over ( 2003 ) in order to avoid a potential Screen Actors Guild strike . Shooting took place over seven weeks in San Miguel de Allende and Guanajuato , Mexico . It was the first big budget film to be shot in high definition digital video . Rodriguez chose to shoot on digital after George Lucas , who was shooting Star Wars : Episode II -- Attack of the Clones , showed him early footage shot digitally . Impressed , Rodriguez chose to shoot digitally , but he knew he did not have enough time to shoot Spy Kids 2 . Instead , he pitched a sequel to Desperado to Miramax and wrote a script in six days . The initial draft was 65 pages long , which he padded with a subplot borrowed from an unproduced short film . When Miramax expressed hesitation over the added subplot , he readily removed it . His primary influence was Sergio Leone 's Dollars Trilogy , specifically The Good , The Bad , and The Ugly . Rodriguez said shooting digitally saved time and money , simplified the filming process , and rendered 35 mm film obsolete for him .",

The book was released on 21 July 2007 , ten years after publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone ( 1997 ) , by Bloomsbury Publishing in the United Kingdom , in the United States by Scholastic , and in Canada by Raincoast Books , ending the series that began in 1997 with the publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone . The novel chronicles the events directly following Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince ( 2005 ) , and the final confrontation between the wizards Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort , as well as revealing the previously concealed back story of several main characters . The title of the book refers to three mythical objects featured in the story , collectively known as the `` Deathly Hallows '' -- an unbeatable wand , a stone to bring the dead to life , and a cloak of invisibility . Rowling finished writing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in January 2007 . Before its release , Bloomsbury reportedly spent £ 10 million to keep the book 's contents safe before its release date . American publisher Arthur Levine refused any copies of the novel to be released in advance for press review , although two reviews were submitted early .

Sometimes a distinction is made between a balance of trade for goods versus one for services . `` Balance of trade '' can be a misleading term because trade measures a flow of exports and imports over a given period of time , rather than a balance of exports and imports at a given point in time . Also , balance of trade does not mean that exports and imports are `` in balance '' with each other or anything else . If a country exports a greater value than it imports , it has a trade surplus or positive balance , and conversely , if a country imports a greater value than it exports , it has a trade deficit or negative balance .

    "question": "where does the london cable car start and finish",
    "context": "The Emirates Air Line is a cable car link across the River Thames in London , England built by Doppelmayr with sponsorship from the airline Emirates . The service opened on 28 June 2012 and is operated by Transport for London . In addition to transport across the river , the service advertises `` a unique view of London '' . The duration of a single crossing is ten minutes ( reduced to five minutes in rush hour as the service speed is increased ) . The service , announced in July 2010 and estimated to cost £ 60,000,000 ; comprises a 1 - kilometre ( 0.62 mi ) gondola line that crosses the Thames from the Greenwich Peninsula to the Royal Victoria Dock , to the west of ExCeL London . Construction of the cable car began in August 2011 . The cable car is based on monocable detachable gondola ( MDG ) technology , a system which uses a single cable for both propulsion and support , used also on the metrocable in Medellín , Colombia . The MDG system is reportedly cheaper and quicker to install than a more complex three - cable system which would allow larger - capacity cars . On 4 July 2010 , Transport for London ( TfL ) announced plans to develop a cable car crossing over the River Thames . It is the first urban cable car in the United Kingdom . Designed by Wilkinson Eyre Architects , Expedition Engineering and Buro Happold , it crosses the river at a height up to 90 metres ( 300 ft ) , higher than that of the nearby O2 Arena . The cable car provides a crossing every 15 seconds , with a maximum capacity of 2,500 passengers per hour in each direction , about 50 busloads . Bicycles may be carried . Passengers can pay for their journeys with pay - as - you - go Oyster cards .",

    "question": "write the name of the fuels commonly used for cooking",
    "context": "Some common properties of liquid fuels are that they are easy to transport , and can be handled with relative ease . Also they are relatively easy to use for all engineering applications , and home use . Fuels like kerosene are rationed in some countries , for example available in government subsidized shops in India for home use . Conventional diesel is similar to gasoline in that it is a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons extracted from petroleum . Kerosene is used in kerosene lamps and as a fuel for cooking , heating , and small engines . Natural gas , composed chiefly of methane , can only exist as a liquid at very low temperatures ( regardless of pressure ) , which limits its direct use as a liquid fuel in most applications . LP gas is a mixture of propane and butane , both of which are easily compressible gases under standard atmospheric conditions . It offers many of the advantages of compressed natural gas ( CNG ) , but is denser than air , does not burn as cleanly , and is much more easily compressed . Commonly used for cooking and space heating , LP gas and compressed propane are seeing increased use in motorized vehicles ; propane is the third most commonly used motor fuel globally . Fuel gas is any one of a number of fuels that under ordinary conditions are gaseous . Many fuel gases are composed of hydrocarbons ( such as methane or propane ) , hydrogen , carbon monoxide , or mixtures thereof . Such gases are sources of potential heat energy or light energy that can be readily transmitted and distributed through pipes from the point of origin directly to the place of consumption . Fuel gas is contrasted with liquid fuels and from solid fuels , though some fuel gases are liquefied for storage or transport . While their gaseous nature can be advantageous , avoiding the difficulty of transporting solid fuel and the dangers of spillage inherent in liquid fuels , it can also be dangerous . It is possible for a fuel gas to be undetected and collect in certain areas , leading to the risk of a gas explosion . For this reason , odorizers are added to most fuel gases so that they may be detected by a distinct smell . The most common type of fuel gas in current use is natural gas .",

    "context": "The Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) is a space telescope that was launched into low Earth orbit in 1990 and remains in operation . Although not the first space telescope , Hubble is one of the largest and most versatile , and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for astronomy . The HST is named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble , and is one of NASA 's Great Observatories , along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory , the Chandra X-ray Observatory , and the Spitzer Space Telescope . With a 2.4 - meter ( 7.9 ft ) mirror , Hubble 's four main instruments observe in the near ultraviolet , visible , and near infrared spectra . Hubble 's orbit outside the distortion of Earth 's atmosphere allows it to take extremely high - resolution images , with substantially lower background light than ground - based telescopes . Hubble has recorded some of the most detailed visible light images ever , allowing a deep view into space and time . Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics , such as accurately determining the rate of expansion of the universe .",

    "question": "who led an all black american cavalry unit",
    "context": "Sources disagree on how the nickname `` Buffalo Soldiers '' began . According to the Buffalo Soldiers National Museum , the name originated with the Cheyenne warriors in the winter of 1877 , the actual Cheyenne translation being `` Wild Buffalo . '' However , writer Walter Hill documented the account of Colonel Benjamin Grierson , who founded the 10th Cavalry regiment , recalling an 1871 campaign against Comanches . Hill attributed the origin of the name to the Comanche due to Grierson 's assertions . The Apache used the same term ( `` We called them ' buffalo soldiers , ' because they had curly , kinky hair ... like bisons '' ) a claim supported by other sources . Some sources assert that the nickname was given out of respect for the fierce fighting ability of the 10th Cavalry . Still other sources point to a combination of both legends . The term Buffalo Soldiers became a generic term for all black soldiers . It is now used for U.S. Army units that trace their direct lineage back to the 9th and 10th Cavalry units , whose service earned them an honored place in U.S. history . According to activist Russell Means , they were called Buffalo Soldiers because the U.S. military created special regiments specifically used to exterminate herds of buffalo . The U.S. military , as part of their campaign in enacting genocidal strategies against American Indians throughout the plains of the continent , removed buffalo in order to cut off American Indian food supply and force them into reservations . During the Civil War , the U.S. government formed regiments known as the United States Colored Troops , composed of black soldiers and Native Americans . After the war , Congress reorganized the Army and authorized the formation of two regiments of black cavalry with the designations 9th and 10th U.S. Cavalry , and four regiments of black infantry , designated the 38th , 39th , 40th , and 41st Infantry Regiments ( Colored ) . The 38th and 41st were reorganized as the 25th Infantry Regiment , with headquarters in Jackson Barracks in New Orleans , Louisiana , in November 1869 . The 39th and 40th were reorganized as the 24th Infantry Regiment , with headquarters at Fort Clark , Texas , in April 1869 . All of these units were composed of black enlisted men commanded by both white and black officers . These included the first commander of the 10th Cavalry Benjamin Grierson , the first commander of the 9th Cavalry Edward Hatch , Medal of Honor recipient Louis H. Carpenter , Nicholas M. Nolan , and the first black graduate of West Point , Henry O. Flipper . From 1866 to the early 1890s , these regiments served at a variety of posts in the Southwestern United States and the Great Plains regions . They participated in most of the military campaigns in these areas and earned a distinguished record . Thirteen enlisted men and six officers from these four regiments earned the Medal of Honor during the Indian Wars . In addition to the military campaigns , the Buffalo Soldiers served a variety of roles along the frontier , from building roads to escorting the U.S. mail . On April 17 , 1875 , regimental headquarters for the 9th and 10th Cavalries were transferred to Fort Concho , Texas . Companies actually arrived at Fort Concho in May 1873 . At various times from 1873 through 1885 , Fort Concho housed 9th Cavalry companies A -- F , K , and M , 10th Cavalry companies A , D -- G , I , L , and M , 24th Infantry companies D -- G , and K , and 25th Infantry companies G and K .",

    "question": "where does the middle east get its name",
    "context": "Most of the countries that border the Persian Gulf have vast reserves of crude oil , with monarchs of the Arabian Peninsula in particular benefiting economically from petroleum exports . The term `` Middle East '' may have originated in the 1850s in the British India Office . However , it became more widely known when American naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan used the term in 1902 to `` designate the area between Arabia and India '' . During this time the British and Russian Empires were vying for influence in Central Asia , a rivalry which would become known as The Great Game . Mahan realized not only the strategic importance of the region , but also of its center , the Persian Gulf . He labeled the area surrounding the Persian Gulf as the Middle East , and said that after Egypt 's Suez Canal , it was the most important passage for Britain to control in order to keep the Russians from advancing towards British India . Mahan first used the term in his article `` The Persian Gulf and International Relations '' , published in September 1902 in the National Review , a British journal . The Middle East , if I may adopt a term which I have not seen , will some day need its Malta , as well as its Gibraltar ; it does not follow that either will be in the Persian Gulf . Naval force has the quality of mobility which carries with it the privilege of temporary absences ; but it needs to find on every scene of operation established bases of refit , of supply , and in case of disaster , of security . The British Navy should have the facility to concentrate in force if occasion arise , about Aden , India , and the Persian Gulf .",

    "question": "what places in the us is weed legal",
    "context": "The medical use of cannabis is legal ( with a doctor 's recommendation ) in 29 states , the District of Columbia , and the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico . Seventeen other states have laws that limit THC content , for the purpose of allowing access to products that are rich in cannabidiol ( CBD ) , a non-psychoactive component of cannabis . Although cannabis remains a Schedule I drug , the Rohrabacher -- Farr amendment prohibits federal prosecution of individuals complying with state medical cannabis laws . The recreational use of cannabis is legal in 9 states ( Alaska , California , Colorado , Maine , Massachusetts , Nevada , Oregon , Vermont , and Washington ) plus the District of Columbia , and decriminalized in another 13 states plus the U.S. Virgin Islands . Commercial distribution of cannabis is allowed in all jurisdictions where cannabis has been legalized , except Vermont and the District of Columbia . Prior to January 2018 , the Cole Memorandum provided some protection against the enforcement of federal law in states that have legalized , but it was rescinded by Attorney General Jeff Sessions . There are currently three cannabinoid drugs ( Marinol , Syndros , and Cesamet ) that can be prescribed in accordance with federal law . The drug cannabidiol can not legally be prescribed ( as with whole - plant cannabis ) , due to the fact that the Drug Enforcement Administration considers it a Schedule I drug . Despite this classification , a number of online retailers sell CBD products to all 50 states , claiming such products are derived from industrial hemp plants and therefore legal . The federal government has so far not taken action against these retailers .",

    "question": "who came up with the group name the temptations",
    "context": "Members of the Distants were acquainted with the Primes as both groups participated in the same talent shows and performed at the same public venues . Friendly rivals , the Primes were considered to be the more polished and vocally stronger group of the two . The Primes disbanded in 1960 after Kell Osborne moved to California . Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams returned to Alabama following the band 's dissolution . While visiting relatives in Detroit , Kendricks called Otis Williams , who desperately needed two more members for an audition for Gordy 's label and offered Kendricks a lead singer place in his new group . Kendricks agreed on the condition he bring Paul Williams with him . Otis Williams happily agreed and Kendricks and Paul Williams moved back to Detroit to join the new group . The original name for the new lineup of Otis Williams , Melvin Franklin , Elbridge `` Al '' Bryant , Eddie Kendricks , and Paul Williams was the Elgins . Under that name , the group auditioned for Motown in March 1961 . Already impressed with some of the members after hearing session work , Berry Gordy agreed to sign the group to the Motown imprint , Miracle . However , before signing , Gordy discovered another group was using the name of Elgins . The group began tossing about ideas for a new name on the steps of the Hitsville U.S.A. studio . On a suggestion from Miracle Records employee Billy Mitchell , songwriter Mickey Stevenson , and group members Otis Williams and Paul Williams , the Temptations became the group 's new moniker . The `` Elgins '' name re-surfaced at Motown in 1965 , when Gordy renamed a quartet called the Downbeats as the Elgins . The Temptations ' first two singles , `` Oh Mother of Mine '' and `` Check Yourself '' , with Paul Williams on lead , were released on Miracle before Gordy closed the label down and reassigned the band to his latest imprint , Gordy Records . On the Gordy imprint , Eddie Kendricks sang lead on the Temptations ' first charted single , `` ( You 're My ) Dream Come True '' , which peaked at number 22 on the R&B chart in 1962 . Later that year , the Temptations began touring as part of the Motortown Revue . The group would issue eight recordings between 1961 - 63 without much success .",

    "context": "Gondwana ( / ɡɒndˈwɑːnə / ) , or Gondwanaland , was a supercontinent that existed from the Neoproterozoic ( about 550 million years ago ) until the Carboniferous ( about 320 million years ago ) . It was formed by the accretion of several cratons . Eventually , Gondwana became the largest piece of continental crust of the Paleozoic Era , covering an area of about 100,000,000 km ( 39,000,000 sq mi ) . During the Carboniferous , it merged with Euramerica to form a larger supercontinent called Pangaea . Gondwana ( and Pangaea ) gradually broke up during the Mesozoic Era . The remnants of Gondwana make up about two - thirds of today 's continental area . The formation of Gondwana began c. 800 to 650 Ma with the East African Orogeny -- the collision of India , Madagascar , and Sri Lanka with East Africa -- and was completed c. 600 to 530 Ma with the overlapping Brasiliano and Kuunga orogenies -- the collision of South America with Africa and the addition of Australia and Antarctica , respectively . The continent of Gondwana was named by Austrian scientist Eduard Suess , after the Gondwana region of central northern India which is derived from Sanskrit for `` forest of the Gonds '' . The name had been previously used in a geological context , first by H.B. Medlicott in 1872 , from which the Gondwana sedimentary sequences ( Permian - Triassic ) are also described . The term `` Gondwanaland '' is preferred by some scientists in order to make a clear distinction between the region and the supercontinent .",

Peaking at # 34 on the Billboard Hot 100 ( and # 11 on the R&B charts ) , the single returned the group to the top forty after a year recording songs that performed below the top forty . This was among the first A-side singles that longtime Marvelettes member Wanda Young sung lead on . Before 1965 , the majority of the leads in Marvelettes songs had belonged to original member Gladys Horton . The single features a woman determined to win the love of an unknowingly conquest telling him that she 'll convince him to love her `` until my will to resist is gone '' . Her Marvelettes band mates Gladys Horton and Katherine Anderson egg her on with her ad - libbing `` oh yeah / sho ' nuff '' in the bridge leading up to the chorus . The single was covered by British mod - pop act , The Action in 1966 , released as `` I 'll Keep On Holding On '' . It then returned across the Atlantic in 1998 to be released on Mink Rat or Rabbit by the Detroit Cobras .",

    "question": "where are calcium ions stored in a cell",
    "context": "Calcium levels in mammals are tightly regulated , with bone acting as the major mineral storage site . Calcium ions , Ca , are released from bone into the bloodstream under controlled conditions . Calcium is transported through the bloodstream as dissolved ions or bound to proteins such as serum albumin . Parathyroid hormone secreted by the parathyroid gland regulates the resorption of Ca from bone , reabsorption in the kidney back into circulation , and increases in the activation of vitamin D to calcitriol . Calcitriol , the active form of vitamin D , promotes absorption of calcium from the intestines and the mobilization of calcium ions from bone matrix . Calcitonin secreted from the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland also affects calcium levels by opposing parathyroid hormone ; however , its physiological significance in humans is dubious . Calcium storages are intracellular organelles , that constantly accumulate Ca ions and release them during certain cellular events . Intracellular Ca storages include mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum . Characteristic concentrations of calcium in model organisms are : in E. coli 3mM ( bound ) , 100nM ( free ) , in budding yeast 2mM ( bound ) , in mammalian cell 10 - 100nM ( free ) and in blood plasma 2mM . In vertebrates , calcium ions , like many other ions , are of such vital importance to many physiological processes that its concentration is maintained within specific limits to ensure adequate homeostasis . This is evidenced by human plasma calcium , which is one of the most closely regulated physiological variables in the human body . Normal plasma levels vary between 1 and 2 % over any given time . Approximately half of all ionized calcium circulates in its unbound form , with the other half being complexed with plasma proteins such as albumin , as well as anions including bicarbonate , citrate , phosphate , and sulfate .",

Beyoncé made the announcement on her website prior to the National Football League 's confirmation by posting an image of her face with the date of the game stenciled into eye black . Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post quipped that she would become the first `` female solo artist under the age of AARP eligibility '' to headline the Super Bowl halftime show . Initial reports mentioned that Beyoncé 's husband , Jay - Z was a potential collaborator on the show .

    "question": "during diagenesis the sediments may undergo ___ changes",
    "context": "Diagenesis ( / ˌdaɪəˈdʒɛnɪsɪs / ) is the change of sediments or existing sedimentary rocks into a different sedimentary rock during and after rock formation ( lithification ) , at temperatures and pressures less than that required for the formation of metamorphic rocks . It does not include changes from weathering . It is any chemical , physical , or biological change undergone by a sediment after its initial deposition , after its lithification . This process excludes surface alteration ( weathering ) and metamorphism . These changes happen at relatively low temperatures and pressures and result in changes to the rock 's original mineralogy and texture . There is no sharp boundary between diagenesis and metamorphism , but the latter occurs at higher temperatures and pressures . Hydrothermal solutions , meteoric groundwater , porosity , permeability , solubility , and time are all influential factors . After deposition , sediments are compacted as they are buried beneath successive layers of sediment and cemented by minerals that precipitate from solution . Grains of sediment , rock fragments and fossils can be replaced by other minerals during diagenesis . Porosity usually decreases during diagenesis , except in rare cases such as dissolution of minerals and dolomitization .",

    "context": "Timon and Pumbaa are an animated meerkat and warthog duo introduced in Disney 's 1994 animated film The Lion King . Timon was portrayed through his many appearances by Nathan Lane ( in all three films and early episodes of the show ) , Max Casella ( the original actor in The Lion King Broadway musical ) , Kevin Schon ( in certain episodes of the show ) , Quinton Flynn ( in certain episodes of the show ) , Bruce Lanoil in the Wild About Safety shorts and Kingdom Hearts II , and while Pumbaa is voiced by Ernie Sabella ( in all of his animated speaking appearances ) , and was portrayed by Tom Alan Robbins in the original cast of the Broadway musical . In the upcoming live - action remake , the characters will be portrayed by Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen respectively . Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella first came to audition for the roles of the hyenas , but when the producers saw how well they worked together they decided to cast them as Timon and Pumbaa . Lyricist Tim Rice however was pulling for Rik Mayall ( for Timon ) and Adrian Edmondson ( for Pumbaa ) to play the roles , as he got the idea for the lyrics to `` Hakuna Matata '' by watching their show Bottom . As with many characters in Lion King , Pumbaa 's name derives from the East African language Swahili . In Swahili , pumbaa ( v . ) means `` to be foolish , silly , weakminded , careless , negligent '' . Timon is one of the few characters whose name has no meaning in Swahili ; Timon is a historical Greek name , taken to mean `` he who respects '' . Timon 's name may also possibly derive from Shakespeare 's tragedy Timon of Athens , another Shakespeare reference in a film which derives its plot from Hamlet .",

There have been 28 Summer Olympic Games held in 24 cities , and 23 Winter Olympic Games held in 20 cities . In addition , three summer and two winter editions of the Games were scheduled to take place but later cancelled due to war : Berlin ( summer ) in 1916 ; Tokyo / Helsinki ( summer ) and Sapporo / Garmisch - Partenkirchen ( winter ) in 1940 ; and London ( summer ) and Cortina d'Ampezzo , Italy ( winter ) in 1944 . The 1906 Summer Olympics were officially sanctioned and held in Athens . However , in 1949 , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) , decided to unrecognize the 1906 Games . Four cities have been chosen by the IOC to host upcoming Olympic Games : Tokyo for the 2020 Summer Olympics , Beijing for the 2022 Winter Olympics , Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics , and Los Angeles for the 2028 Summer Olympics . In 2022 , Beijing will become the only city that has held both the summer and the winter Olympic Games . Nine cities will have hosted the Olympic Games more than once : Athens ( 1896 and 2004 Summer Olympics ) , Paris ( 1900 , 1924 and 2024 Summer Olympics ) , London ( 1908 , 1948 and 2012 Summer Olympics ) , St. Moritz ( 1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics ) , Lake Placid ( 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics ) , Los Angeles ( 1932 , 1984 and 2028 Summer Olympics ) , Innsbruck ( 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics ) , Tokyo ( 1964 and 2020 Summer Olympics ) and Beijing ( 2008 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics ) . In addition , Stockholm hosted the 1912 Summer Olympics and the equestrian portion of the 1956 Summer Olympics . London became the first city to have hosted three Games with the 2012 Summer Olympics . Paris will become the second city to do this with the 2024 Summer Olympics , followed by Los Angeles as the third in 2028 .

The player with the most home runs in the first round faced the player with the least among the four qualifying players , as did the players with the second - and third-most totals . The contestant who won each matchup advanced to the finals . This format was discontinued after the 2003 competition . The field of players selected currently consists of four American League players and four National League players . The first Derby in 1985 featured five from each league , and the 1986 and 1987 events featured three and two players from each league , respectively . In 1996 , the field was again expanded to ten players , five from each league ( though in 1997 , the AL had six contestants to the NL 's four ) . In 2000 , the field reverted to the current four - player - per - league format . The only exception was 2005 , when Major League Baseball changed the selection criteria with eight players representing their home countries rather than their respective leagues . The change was believed to be in promotion of the inaugural World Baseball Classic , played in March 2006 . In 2006 , the selection of four players from each league resumed . In 2011 , the format was revised so that team captains selected the individual sides .",

    "question": "what does cantina mean in english from spanish",
    "context": "In rural Mexico , a cantina traditionally is a kind of bar frequented by males for drinking alcohol and eating botanas ( appetizers ) . Some cantinas are also known for being places where people gather to play dominoes , cards or other table games . Cantinas can often be distinguished by signs that expressly prohibit entrance to women and minors , as opposed to a club , salon de bailar ( dance hall ) , or salon de mariachi ( typified by the Salon Tenampa , at the Plaza Garibaldi in Mexico City ) which are intended for socializing between the sexes . Also , some cantinas explicitly prohibit entrance to dogs and men in police or military uniform . Some of the traditional restrictions on entry to cantinas are beginning to fade away . However , in many areas it is still viewed as scandalous for proper ladies to be seen visiting a genuine cantina . A cantina in the U.S. is simply a tavern with a Southwestern or Mexican motif that serves traditional alcoholic Mexican drinks . In the 1890s , cantina entered American English from the Spanish language in the Southwest United States with the meaning of `` bar room , saloon . ''",

    "context": "The Doobie Brothers are an American rock band from San Jose , California . The group has sold more than 40 million albums worldwide throughout its career . The band has been active for five decades , with its biggest success occurring in the 1970s . The band 's history can be roughly divided into three eras . From 1970 to 1975 it featured lead vocalist Tom Johnston and featured a mainstream rock and roll sound with elements of folk , country and R&B . Johnston quit the group in 1975 , and was replaced with Michael McDonald whose interest in soul music changed the sound of the band until it broke up in 1982 . The Doobie Brothers reformed in 1987 with Johnston back in the fold and are still active to the present with occasional contributions from McDonald . Every incarnation of the group emphasized vocal harmonies from the band 's members . The Doobie Brothers were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004 . Drummer John Hartman arrived in California determined to meet Skip Spence of Moby Grape and join an aborted Grape reunion . Spence introduced Hartman to singer , guitarist , and songwriter Tom Johnston and the two proceeded to form the nucleus of what would become the Doobie Brothers . Johnston and Hartman called their fledgling group `` Pud '' and experimented with lineups ( occasionally including Spence ) and styles as they performed in and around San Jose . They were mostly a power trio ( along with bassist Greg Murphy ) but briefly worked with a horn section .",

    "question": "who discovered the fact that south america was a separate continent",
    "context": "Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to the West Indies in 1492 , sparking a period of European exploration of the Americas . But despite four voyages to the Americas , Columbus never believed he had reached a new continent -- he always thought it was part of Asia . In 1501 , Amerigo Vespucci and Gonçalo Coelho attempted to sail around what they considered the southern end of the Asian mainland into the Indian Ocean , passing through Fernando de Noronha . After reaching the coast of Brazil , they sailed a long way further south along the coast of South America , confirming that this was a land of continental proportions and that it also extended much further south than Asia was known to . On return to Europe , an account of the voyage , called Mundus Novus ( `` New World '' ) , was published under Vespucci 's name in 1502 or 1503 , although it seems that it had additions or alterations by another writer . Regardless of who penned the words , Mundus Novus credited Vespucci with saying , `` I have discovered a continent in those southern regions that is inhabited by more numerous people and animals than our Europe , or Asia or Africa '' , the first known explicit identification of part of the Americas as a continent like the other three . Within a few years the name `` New World '' began appearing as a name for South America on world maps , such as the Oliveriana ( Pesaro ) map of around 1504 -- 1505 . Maps of this time though , still showed North America connected to Asia and showed South America as a separate land .",

He also told radio host talk show Drew Marshall that The Shack `` is a metaphor for the places you get stuck , you get hurt , you get damaged ... the thing where shame or hurt is centered . '' The novel is set in the American Northwest . The main character is Mackenzie Allen Phillips , a father of five , called `` Mack '' by his family and friends . Four years prior to the main events of the story , Mack takes three of his children on a camping trip to Wallowa Lake near Joseph , Oregon , stopping at Multnomah Falls on the way . Two of his children are playing in a canoe when it flips and almost drowns Mack 's son . Mack is able to save his son by rushing to the water and freeing him from the canoe 's webbing , but unintentionally leaves his youngest daughter Missy alone at their campsite . After Mack returns , he sees that Missy is missing . The police are called , and the family discovers that Missy has been abducted and murdered by a serial killer known as the `` Little Ladykiller '' . The police find an abandoned shack in the woods where Missy was taken . Her bloodied clothing is found , but her body is not located . Mack 's life sinks into what he calls `` The Great Sadness '' . As the novel begins , Mack receives a note in his mailbox from `` Papa '' , saying that he would like to meet with Mack that coming weekend at the shack . Mack is puzzled by the note -- he has had no relationship with his abusive father since he left home at age 13 . He suspects that the note may be from God whom his wife Nan refers to as `` Papa '' .",

    "question": "where does the phosphorus found in living things originate",
    "context": "Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for plants and animals . Phosphorus is a limiting nutrient for aquatic organisms . Phosphorus forms parts of important life - sustaining molecules that are very common in the biosphere . Phosphorus does not enter the atmosphere , remaining mostly on land and in rock and soil minerals . Eighty percent of the mined phosphorus is used to make fertilizers . Phosphates from fertilizers , sewage and detergents can cause pollution in lakes and streams . Overenrichment of phosphate in both fresh and inshore marine waters can lead to massive algae blooms which , when they die and decay , leads to eutrophication of fresh waters only . An example of this is the Canadian Experimental Lakes Area . These freshwater algal blooms should not be confused with those in saltwater environments . Recent research suggests that the predominant pollutant responsible for algal blooms in salt water estuaries and coastal marine habitats is Nitrogen . Phosphorus occurs most abundantly in nature as part of the orthophosphate ion ( PO ) , consisting of a P atom and 4 oxygen atoms . On land most phosphorus is found in rocks and minerals . Phosphorus rich deposits have generally formed in the ocean or from guano , and over time , geologic processes bring ocean sediments to land . Weathering of rocks and minerals release phosphorus in a soluble form where it is taken up by plants , and it is transformed into organic compounds . The plants may then be consumed by herbivores and the phosphorus is either incorporated into their tissues or excreted . After death , the animal or plant decays , and phosphorus is returned to the soil where a large part of the phosphorus is transformed into insoluble compounds . Runoff may carry a small part of the phosphorus back to the ocean . Generally with time ( thousands of years ) soils become deficient in phosphorus leading to ecosystem retrogression . The primary biological importance of phosphates is as a component of nucleotides , which serve as energy storage within cells ( ATP ) or when linked together , form the nucleic acids DNA and RNA . The double helix of our DNA is only possible because of the phosphate ester bridge that binds the helix . Besides making biomolecules , phosphorus is also found in bone and the enamel of mammalian teeth , whose strength is derived from calcium phosphate in the form of Hydroxylapatite . It is also found in the exoskeleton of insects , and phospholipids ( found in all biological membranes ) . It also functions as a buffering agent in maintaining acid base homeostasis in the human body .",

Sullivan developed a co-production between the CBC and PBS in order to film Anne of Green Gables . Sullivan amalgamated many of Montgomery 's episodes into the film 's plot .

Primary locations for filming the movie included Prince Edward Island , Stouffville , Ontario , Jacksons Point , Ontario , and Westfield Heritage Village in the Hamilton , Ontario neighbourhood of Rockton . Filming was done over a consecutive ten - week shoot . Sullivan used several locations as Green Gables farm and combined them to appear as one property .

    "context": "While the name is unisex , within the United Kingdom it is more generally considered to be a female name , perhaps in part because of its association with the `` Essex girl '' . Particularly during the 1980s , alongside the name Sharon , it was a name considered to be archetypal of the Essex girl . Its popularity peaked during the 1960s , when Tracey was the sixth most popular female name and the alternate spelling Tracy was the 12th most popular in 1964 . The Irish name Tracey is derived from the native Irish O'Treasaigh septs . The name is taken from the Irish word `` treasach '' meaning `` war - like '' or `` fighter '' . It is also translated as `` higher '' , `` more powerful '' or `` superior '' . It may also be derived from the Irish word for three , with an association to the Tuatha Dé Danann . The first reference to the surname in the Irish Annals was in 1008 : `` Gussan , son of Ua Treassach , lord of Ui - Bairrche , died . ''",

    "question": "where are salt marshes located in the us",
    "context": "Salt marshes occur on low - energy shorelines in temperate and high - latitudes which can be stable or emerging , or submerging if the sedimentation rate exceeds the subsidence rate . Commonly these shorelines consist of mud or sand flats ( known also as tidal flats or abbreviated to mudflats ) which are nourished with sediment from inflowing rivers and streams . These typically include sheltered environments such as embankments , estuaries and the leeward side of barrier islands and spits . In the tropics and sub-tropics they are replaced by mangroves ; an area that differs from a salt marsh in that instead of herbaceous plants , they are dominated by salt - tolerant trees . Most salt marshes have a low topography with low elevations but a vast wide area , making them hugely popular for human populations . Salt marshes are located among different landforms based on their physical and geomorphological settings . Such marsh landforms include deltaic marshes , estuarine , back - barrier , open coast , embayments and drowned - valley marshes . Deltaic marshes are associated with large rivers where many occur in Southern Europe such as the Camargue , France in the Rhone delta or the Ebro delta in Spain . They are also extensive within the rivers of the Mississippi Delta in the United States . In New Zealand , most salt marshes occur at the head of estuaries in areas where there is little wave action and high sedimentation . Such marshes are located in Awhitu Regional Park in Auckland , the Manawatu Estuary , and the Avon - Heathcote Estuary in Christchurch . Back - barrier marshes are sensitive to the reshaping of barriers in the landward side of which they have been formed . They are common along much of the eastern coast of the United States and the Frisian Islands . Large , shallow coastal embayments can hold salt marshes with examples including Morecambe Bay and Portsmouth in Britain and the Bay of Fundy in North America . Salt marshes are sometimes included in lagoons , and the difference is not very marked ; the Venetian Lagoon in Italy , for example , is made up of these sorts of animals and or living organisms belonging to this ecosystem . They have a big impact on the biodiversity of the area . Salt marsh ecology involves complex food webs which include primary producers ( vascular plants , macroalgae , diatoms , epiphytes , and phytoplankton ) , primary consumers ( zooplankton , macrozoa , molluscs , insects ) , and secondary consumers .",

    "question": "st segment elevation myocardial infarction signs and symptoms",
    "context": "Myocardial infarction ( MI ) , commonly known as a heart attack , occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to a part of the heart , causing damage to the heart muscle . The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder , arm , back , neck , or jaw . Often it occurs in the center or left side of the chest and lasts for more than a few minutes . The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn . Other symptoms may include shortness of breath , nausea , feeling faint , a cold sweat , or feeling tired . About 30 % of people have atypical symptoms . Women more often have atypical symptoms than men . Among those over 75 years old , about 5 % have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms . An MI may cause heart failure , an irregular heartbeat , cardiogenic shock , or cardiac arrest . Most MIs occur due to coronary artery disease . Risk factors include high blood pressure , smoking , diabetes , lack of exercise , obesity , high blood cholesterol , poor diet , and excessive alcohol intake , among others . The complete blockage of a coronary artery caused by a rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque is usually the underlying mechanism of an MI . MIs are less commonly caused by coronary artery spasms , which may be due to cocaine , significant emotional stress , and extreme cold , among others . A number of tests are useful to help with diagnosis , including electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) , blood tests , and coronary angiography . An ECG , which is a recording of the heart 's electrical activity , may confirm an ST elevation MI ( STEMI ) if ST elevation is present . Commonly used blood tests include troponin and less often creatine kinase MB .",

    "question": "list the structures of the nephron where filtration occurs",
    "context": "The nephron ( from Greek νεφρός -- nephros , meaning `` kidney '' ) is the microscopic structural and functional unit of the kidney . It is composed of a renal corpuscle and a renal tubule . The renal corpuscle consists of a tuft of capillaries called a glomerulus and an encompassing Bowman 's capsule . The renal tubule extends from the capsule . The capsule and tubule are connected and are composed of epithelial cells with a lumen . A healthy adult has 0.8 to 1.5 million nephrons in each kidney . Blood is filtered as it passes through three layers : the endothelial cells of the capillary wall , its basement membrane , and between the foot processes of the podocytes of the lining of the capsule . The tubule has adjacent peritubular capillaries that run between the descending and ascending portions of the tubule . As the fluid from the capsule flows down into the tubule , it is processed by the epithelial cells lining the tubule : water is reabsorbed and substances are exchanged ( some are added , others are removed ) ; first with the interstitial fluid outside the tubules , and then into the plasma in the adjacent peritubular capillaries through the endothelial cells lining that capillary . This process regulates the volume of body fluid as well as levels of many body substances . At the end of the tubule , the remaining fluid -- urine -- exits : it is composed of water , metabolic waste , and toxins . Bowman 's capsule has a space that collects the filtrate , called Bowman 's space ; the filtering capillaries of the glomerulus , and the mesangial cells supporting these capillaries . These components function as the filtration unit and make up the renal corpuscle . The filtering structure ( glomerular filtration barrier ) has three layers composed of endothelial cells , a basement membrane , and podocytes ( foot processes ) . The tubule has five anatomically and functionally different parts : the proximal tubule , which has a convoluted section the proximal convoluted tubule followed by a straight section ( proximal straight tubule ) ; the loop of Henle , which has two parts , the descending loop of Henle ( `` descending loop '' ) and the ascending loop of Henle ( `` ascending loop '' ) ; the distal convoluted tubule ( `` distal loop '' ) ; the connecting tubule , and the collecting ducts . Nephrons have two lengths with different urine concentrating capacities : long juxtamedullary nephrons and short cortical nephrons .",

    "context": "In the United Kingdom , Ireland , and the United States , use of the defense is rare ; however , since the Criminal Procedure ( Insanity and Unfitness to Plead ) Act 1991 , insanity pleas have steadily increased in the UK . Mitigating factors , including things not eligible for the insanity defense such as intoxication ( or , more frequently , diminished capacity ) , may lead to reduced charges or reduced sentences . The defense is based on evaluations by forensic mental health professionals with the appropriate test according to the jurisdiction . Their testimony guides the jury , but they are not allowed to testify to the accused 's criminal responsibility , as this is a matter for the jury to decide . Similarly , mental health practitioners are restrained from making a judgment on the issue of whether the defendant is or is not insane or what is known as the `` ultimate issue '' . Some jurisdictions require the evaluation to address the defendant 's ability to control their behavior at the time of the offense ( the volitional limb ) . A defendant claiming the defense is pleading `` not guilty by reason of insanity '' ( NGRI ) or `` guilty but insane or mentally ill '' in some jurisdictions which , if successful , may result in the defendant being committed to a psychiatric facility for an indeterminate period .",

It is the third tablet in the Google Nexus series , a family of Android consumer devices marketed by Google and built by an original equipment manufacturer partner . Following the success of the original Nexus 7 , a second generation of the device was released on July 26 , 2013 , four days earlier than the originally scheduled date due to early releases from various retailers . The tablet was the first device to ship with version 4.3 of Android . The second iteration of the 7 in ( 180 mm ) tablet , code named `` Razor '' , has various upgrades from the previous generation , including a 1.5 GHz quad - core Snapdragon S4 Pro processor , 2 GB of memory , a 1920 × 1200 pixel display ( 323 pixels per inch ; 127 ppcm ) , dual cameras ( 1.2 MP front , 5 MP rear ) , stereo speakers , built - in inductive Qi wireless charging , and a SlimPort ( via micro USB connector ) capable of full high - definition video output to an external display . Nexus 7 was the first device to have been shipped with Android version 4.3 ( `` Jelly Bean '' ) . All Nexus devices , including the Nexus 7 , run a version of Android free of manufacturer or wireless carrier modifications ( e.g. , custom graphical user interfaces or ' skins ' such as TouchWiz and HTC Sense ) commonly included on other Android devices . Nexus products also feature an unlockable bootloader , which enabled `` rooting '' the device , thereby enabling user access to privileged control over the Android environment , which in turn enables further development or modification of the operating system or replacement of the device 's firmware . An update to Android 4.4 was released in November 2013 , followed by another update to Android 4.4. 2 one month later and eventually an update to Android 4.4. 3 in June 2014 and 4.4. 4 in July . The Wi - Fi only variant of the Nexus 7 was one of the two devices of which the Android L developer preview was officially available for , with the other being the Nexus 5 . Android 5.0 `` Lollipop '' was released in November 2014 for The Wi - Fi only version . In July 2015 , Android 5.1. 1 was rolled out to the Nexus 7 , containing a fix for the Stagefright bug .",

    "context": "In the United States , Medicare is a national health insurance program , now administered by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services of the U.S. federal government but begun in 1966 under the Social Security Administration . United States Medicare is funded by a combination of a payroll tax , premiums and surtaxes from beneficiaries , and general revenue . It provides health insurance for Americans aged 65 and older who have worked and paid into the system through the payroll tax . It also provides health insurance to younger people with some disability status as determined by the Social Security Administration , as well as people with end stage renal disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . In 2015 , Medicare provided health insurance for over 55 million -- 46 million people age 65 and older and 9 million younger people . On average , Medicare covers about half of the healthcare charges for those enrolled . The enrollees must then cover their remaining costs either with supplemental insurance , separate insurance , or out of pocket . Out - of - pocket costs can vary depending on the amount of healthcare a Medicare enrollee needs . These out - of - pocket costs might include deductibles and co-pays ; the costs of uncovered services -- such as for long - term , dental , hearing , and vision care -- and supplemental insurance premiums .",

    "question": "where does gluconeogenesis take place in eukaryotic cells",
    "context": "The existence of glyoxylate cycles in humans has not been established , and it is widely held that fatty acids can not be converted to glucose in humans directly . However , carbon - 14 has been shown to end up in glucose when it is supplied in fatty acids . Despite these findings , it is considered unlikely that the 2 - carbon acetyl - CoA derived from the oxidation of fatty acids would produce a net yield of glucose via the citric acid cycle -- however , acetyl - CoA can be converted into pyruvate and lactate through the ketogenic pathway . Put simply , acetic acid ( in the form of acetyl - CoA ) is used to partially produce glucose ; acetyl groups can only form part of the glucose molecules ( not the 5th carbon atom ) and require extra substrates ( such as pyruvate ) in order to form the rest of the glucose molecule . But a roundabout pathway does lead from acetyl - coA to pyruvate , via acetoacetate , acetone , hydroxyacetone ( acetol ) and then either propylene glycol or methylglyoxal . In mammals , gluconeogenesis has been believed to be restricted to the liver , the kidney , the intestine , and muscle , but recent evidence indicates gluconeogenesis occurring in astrocytes of the brain . These organs use somewhat different gluconeogenic precursors . The liver preferentially uses lactate , alanine and glycerol ( especially alanine ) while the kidney preferentially uses lactate , glutamine and glycerol ( especially glutamine ) . Lactate from the Cori cycle is quantitatively the largest source of substrate for gluconeogenesis , especially for the kidney . The liver uses both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to produce glucose , whereas the kidney only uses gluconeogenesis . After a meal , the liver shifts to glycogen synthesis , whereas the kidney increases gluconeogenesis . The intestine uses mostly glutamine and glycerol . Propionate is the principal substrate for gluconeogenesis in the ruminant liver , and the ruminant liver may make increased use of gluconeogenic amino acids , e.g. alanine , when glucose demand is increased . The capacity of liver cells to use lactate for gluconeogenesis declines from the preruminant stage to the ruminant stage in calves and lambs . In sheep kidney tissue , very high rates of gluconeogenesis from propionate have been observed .",

Previously , Rochester had shared 716 with Buffalo . Aside from new area codes created in the New York City metropolitan area and Long Island , 585 was the second new area code in New York since 1954 , having been preceded by 845 . The border between 716 and 585 roughly matches county lines ( without regard to mailing address ) which causes confusion where a ZIP code overlaps a municipal boundary . Therefore , some ZIP codes have phone numbers in two area codes . Among these places : Arcade , Cuba , Akron , and Alden . A significant part of Ontario County uses 315 . Part of the town of Farmington is north of the NY Thruway ( Interstate 90 ) , and is `` joined '' with Wayne County in the 315 area code .",

It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe , marking the beginning of the Modern age . The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its own invented version of humanism , derived from the concept of Roman Humanitas and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy , such as that of Protagoras , who said that `` Man is the measure of all things . '' This new thinking became manifest in art , architecture , politics , science and literature . Early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the recycled knowledge of how to make concrete . Although the invention of metal movable type sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century , the changes of the Renaissance were not uniformly experienced across Europe .",

    "question": "when and where did the revival of the olympics take place",
    "context": "Between 1862 and 1867 , Liverpool held an annual Grand Olympic Festival . Devised by John Hulley and Charles Melly , these games were the first to be wholly amateur in nature and international in outlook , although only ' gentlemen amateurs ' could compete . The programme of the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool Olympics . In 1865 Hulley , Brookes and E.G. Ravenstein founded the National Olympian Association in Liverpool , a forerunner of the British Olympic Association . Its articles of foundation provided the framework for the International Olympic Charter . In 1866 , a national Olympic Games in Great Britain was organised at London 's Crystal Palace . Greek interest in reviving the Olympic Games began with the Greek War of Independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1821 . It was first proposed by poet and newspaper editor Panagiotis Soutsos in his poem `` Dialogue of the Dead '' , published in 1833 . Evangelos Zappas , a wealthy Greek - Romanian philanthropist , first wrote to King Otto of Greece , in 1856 , offering to fund a permanent revival of the Olympic Games . Zappas sponsored the first Olympic Games in 1859 , which was held in an Athens city square . Athletes participated from Greece and the Ottoman Empire . Zappas funded the restoration of the ancient Panathenaic Stadium so that it could host all future Olympic Games . The stadium hosted Olympics in 1870 and 1875 . Thirty thousand spectators attended that Games in 1870 , though no official attendance records are available for the 1875 Games . In 1890 , after attending the Olympian Games of the Wenlock Olympian Society , Baron Pierre de Coubertin was inspired to found the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) . Coubertin built on the ideas and work of Brookes and Zappas with the aim of establishing internationally rotating Olympic Games that would occur every four years . He presented these ideas during the first Olympic Congress of the newly created International Olympic Committee . This meeting was held from 16 to 23 June 1894 , at the University of Paris . On the last day of the Congress , it was decided that the first Olympic Games to come under the auspices of the IOC would take place in Athens in 1896 . The IOC elected the Greek writer Demetrius Vikelas as its first president .",

    "question": "names of the parts of the human brain",
    "context": "The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum . The cerebrum is connected by the brainstem to the spinal cord . The brainstem consists of the midbrain , the pons , and the medulla oblongata . The cerebellum is connected to the brainstem by pairs of tracts . Within the cerebrum is the ventricular system , consisting of four interconnected ventricles in which cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated . Underneath the cerebral cortex are several important structures , including the thalamus , the epithalamus , the pineal gland , the hypothalamus , the pituitary gland , and the subthalamus ; the limbic structures , including the amygdala and the hippocampus ; the claustrum , the various nuclei of the basal ganglia ; the basal forebrain structures , and the three circumventricular organs . The cells of the brain include neurons and supportive glial cells . There are more than 86 billion neurons in the brain , and a more or less equal number of other cells . Brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons and their release of neurotransmitters in response to nerve impulses . Neurons form elaborate neural networks of neural pathways and circuits . The whole circuitry is driven by the process of neurotransmission .",

    "context": "In 1966 , Everton became only the second side ever to win the cup after being two goals down , without the need of extra time . The Merseysiders had gone two goals down with thirty - one minutes remaining before coming back to win 3 -- 2 , emulating Blackpool 's achievement of thirteen years earlier , however , while Blackpool had been up against a Bolton side reduced to nine fit men , Sheffield Wednesday , by contrast , were in no way handicapped . The match , however , was largely forgotten as it was overshadowed by England 's World Cup victory later that year . The record for most FA Cup wins by a player is held by Ashley Cole , who has won it seven times ( with Arsenal in 2002 , 2003 and 2005 , and Chelsea in 2007 , 2009 , 2010 and 2012 ) . With Chelsea 's victory over Portsmouth in the 2010 final , Cole beat the record of five jointly held by Charles Wollaston ( Wanderers ) , Arthur Kinnaird ( Wanderers & Old Etonians ) and Jimmy Forrest ( Blackburn Rovers ) .

    "question": "who sang shall we dance in the king and i",
    "context": "`` Shall We Dance ? '' is a show tune from the 1951 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical , The King and I. It is sung by Anna Leonowens and the King of Siam , played by Gertrude Lawrence ( in the original Broadway production ) and Yul Brynner respectively . In addition , it was sung by Valerie Hobson in the original London West End production , and Marni Nixon ( who only voiced - over songs while Deborah Kerr acted ) in the 1956 film of The King and I . The song is about Anna reminiscing over the idea of finding love at an English dance . The song comes about after a conflict of love 's meaning between Anna and the King ; the King believes that love is a `` silly complication of a pleasant simplicity '' and a `` fairy tale '' while Anna believes that love is real and is natural . They sing the song `` The Song of the King '' which expresses predominantly the viewpoint of the King . After the song , Anna is trying to explain the idea of love in a simple way to the King and becomes caught up in her own experience of love at first sight which is told in the song `` Shall We Dance ? '' . The song is most famous for the polka style dance between Anna and the King . The King , however , exaggerates the movements of the dance with more leaps than strides . The dance usually takes up a large part of the stage .",

    "question": "number of cities and towns in rhode island",
    "context": "Rhode Island is a state located in the Northeastern United States . According to the 2010 United States Census , Rhode Island is the 8th least populous state with 7006105256700000000 ♠ 1,052,567 inhabitants and the smallest by land area spanning 1,033.81 square miles ( 2,677.6 km ) of land . Rhode Island is divided into 39 incorporated municipalities , including 8 cities and 31 towns , grouped into 5 historic counties which have no municipal functions as the state has no county level of government . The entire area of the state is governed by town administrations except for areas within the boundaries of cities . Municipalities in Rhode Island can incorporate as a town or city by a special act of the state legislature and there is no minimum population requirement . Eight municipalities were re -- incorporated as cities operating under a charter , while the other thirty -- one remain as towns which perform similar services . Since Rhode Island has no county level of government , cities and towns provide services commonly performed by county governments in other states . Rhode Island 's cities and towns may adopt one of four different forms of government : council -- manager , mayor -- council , town council -- town meeting , or administrator -- council . The primary difference between these forms of government is how the chief executive is selected . The Council -- manager system involves an elected council who exercise overall control of the local government and a chief executive termed city or town manager who is generally appointed by and responsible to the council for the administration of local policies . Council -- manager systems may elect a mayor but they have no formal administrative functions with the potential exception of a degree of veto power . Mayor -- council systems have a similarly elected council however the mayor is elected and yields administrative power . In the town council -- town meeting system , there is no full -- time chief executive . There are no towns or cities in Rhode Island that use the administrator -- council form of government .",

    "question": "which 2 countries were able to participate in the cash and carry program",
    "context": "Though `` Cash and Carry '' concepts had been introduced in the Neutrality Act of 1936 , it only pertained to materials that could not be used in war efforts , which allowed them to aid warring countries . Originally presented to Congress by Senator Key Pittman ( D - NV ) earlier in 1939 , the bill was designed to replace the Neutrality Act of 1937 , which had lapsed in May 1939 . The bill had been defeated repeatedly by the Senate and the House on more than one occasion as Isolationists feared that passing the bill would draw the US into the conflict in Europe . However , President Roosevelt felt that further help was needed in Europe after Germany invaded Poland in September 1939 . The bill passed in late October , gaining approval from the House on November 5 , 1939 . The President gave his signature the same day . The purpose of this policy was to maintain neutrality between the United States and European countries while giving aid to Britain by allowing them to buy non war materials . Various policies , such as the Neutrality Acts of 1935 , 1936 , and 1937 , forbade selling implements of war or lending money to belligerent countries under any terms . The U.S. economy was rebounding at this time , following the Great Depression , but there was still a need for industrial manufacturing jobs . The cash and carry program helped to solve this issue and in turn Great Britain benefited from the purchase goods . This program also prevented US businesses interests backing the success or failure of any warring nation . Because of the conclusion of the Nye Committee , which asserted that United States involvement in World War I was driven by private interests from arms manufacturers , many Americans believed that investment in a belligerent would eventually lead to American participation in war .",

    "context": "Hull House was a settlement house in the United States that was co-founded in 1889 by Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr . Located in the Near West Side of Chicago , Illinois , Hull House ( named after the home 's first owner Charles Jerald Hull ) opened to recently arrived European immigrants . By 1911 , Hull House had grown to 13 buildings . In 1912 the Hull House complex was completed with the addition of a summer camp , the Bowen Country Club . With its innovative social , educational , and artistic programs , Hull House became the standard bearer for the movement that had grown , by 1920 , to almost 500 settlement houses nationally . Most of the Hull House buildings were demolished for the construction of the University of Illinois - Circle Campus in the mid-1960s . The Hull mansion and several subsequent acquisitions were continuously renovated to accommodate the changing demands of the association . The original building and one additional building ( which has been moved 200 yards ( 182.9 m ) ) survive today . On June 12 , 1974 , the Hull House building was designated a Chicago Landmark . On June 23 , 1965 , it was designated as a U.S. National Historic Landmark . On October 15 , 1966 , which is the day that the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 was enacted , it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places . Hull House was one of the four original members to be listed on both the Chicago Registered Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places list ( along with Chicago Pile - 1 , Robie House & Lorado Taft Midway Studios ) . The Hull House Association ceased operations in January 2012 , but the Hull mansion and a related dining hall remain open as a museum .",

    "question": "what is the habitat of the green sea turtle",
    "context": "On 30 December 2007 , fishermen using a hulbot - hulbot ( a type of fishnet ) accidentally caught an 80 kg ( 180 lb ) , 93 cm ( 37 in ) long and 82 cm ( 32 in ) wide turtle off Barangay Bolong , Zamboanga City , Philippines . December is breeding season near the Bolong beach . Green sea turtles move across three habitat types , depending on their life stage . They lay eggs on beaches . Mature turtles spend most of their time in shallow , coastal waters with lush seagrass beds . Adults frequent inshore bays , lagoons and shoals with lush seagrass meadows . Entire generations often migrate between one pair of feeding and nesting areas . Green sea turtles , Chelonia mydas , are classified as an aquatic species and are distributed around the globe in warm tropical to subtropical waters . The environmental parameter that limits the distribution of the turtles is ocean temperatures below 7 to 10 degrees Celsius . Within their geographical range , the green sea turtles generally stay near continental and island coastlines . Near the coastlines , the green sea turtles live within shallow bays and protected shores . In these protected shores and bays , the green sea turtle habitats include coral reefs , salt marshes , and nearshore seagrass beds . The coral reefs provide red , brown , and green algae for their diet and gives protection from predators and rough storms within the ocean . The salt marshes and seagrass beds contain seaweed and grass vegetation , allowing ample habitat for the sea turtles . Turtles spend most of their first five years in convergence zones within the bare open ocean that surround them . These young turtles are rarely seen as they swim in deep , pelagic waters . Green sea turtles typically swim at 2.5 -- 3 km / h ( 1.6 -- 1.9 mph ) .",

    "context": "The Voice is an international reality television singing competition franchise . It is based on the reality singing competition The Voice of Holland , which was originally created by Dutch television producer John de Mol . Many other countries have adapted the format and begun airing their own versions since 2011 . It has become a rival to the Idols franchise , Rising Star and The X Factor . John de Mol , creator of Big Brother , first created The Voice concept with Dutch singer Roel van Velzen . Erland Galjaard , a Dutch program director , asked John de Mol about whether he could come up with a format that went a step further than The X Factor . De Mol then came with the idea of Blind Audition . He wanted to focus on singing quality alone , so the coaches must be top artists in music industry . The rotating chairs concept was invented by Roel van Velzen . It would also be the first talent show in which social media is actively involved . On September 17 , 2010 , The Voice of Holland began to air on RTL 4 with Angela Groothuizen , Roel van Velzen , Nick & Simon , and Jeroen van der Boom as the mentor - judges ( dubbed as `` coaches '' ) of the show . The show proved to be an instant success in the Netherlands .",

    "context": "The plot is set in a fictional history of real - world events and follows the centuries - old struggle between the Assassins , who fight for peace with liberty , and the Templars , who desire peace through order . The story is set in Victorian era London and follows twin assassins Jacob and Evie Frye as they navigate the corridors of organized crime , and take back the city from Templar control . The open world design lets players freely roam London . The game is played from a third - person perspective and its world is navigated on foot or by carriage . The game introduces new traveling systems and refined combat and stealth mechanics . Players control the two lead protagonists -- twins Jacob and Evie Frye -- throughout the game 's story , switching between them both during and outside of missions . Unlike its direct predecessors , Syndicate does not feature any multiplayer gameplay . Assassin 's Creed Syndicate received positive reviews . Critics praised the visuals , the likability of the major characters , especially the Frye twins and the antagonist , the interwoven structure of the sidequests and main objectives , creative mission design , as well as the lightheartedness of the game and the entertaining story . Criticism was directed at the lackluster ending as well as the aging and repetitive gameplay and the lack of diverse character - models , yet overall critics agreed that it was a major improvement over Unity . Assassin 's Creed Syndicate was nominated for multiple awards in 2015 , including `` action - adventure '' of the year 2015 at The Game Awards .

    "context": "After the formation , the Heaven was above and Earth was still a drifting soft mush . The first five gods named Kotoamatsukami ( 別 天津 神 , `` Separate Heavenly Deities '' ) were lone deities without gender and did not procreate . Then came the Kamiyonanayo ( 神 世 七 代 , `` The Seven Divine Generations '' ) , consisting of two lone deities followed by five couples . It was the last couple , Izanagi and Izanami that gave earth its solid form and first procreated other gods . The elder gods delegated the youngest couple Izanagi and Izanami to carry out their venerable mandate : to reach down from heaven and give solid form to the earth . This they did with the use of a precious stone - covered spear named Ame - no - nuboko ( 天沼 矛 , `` heavenly jewelled spear '' ) , given to them by the elders . Standing over the Ame - no - ukihashi ( 天 浮橋 , `` floating bridge of heaven '' ) , they churned the chaotic mass with the spear . When drops of salty water fell from the tip , they formed into the first island , Onogoroshima . In forming this island , both gods came down from heaven , and spontaneously built a central support column called the Ame - no - mihashira ( 天 御 柱 , `` heavenly pillar '' ) which upheld the `` hall measuring eight fathoms '' that the gods caused to appear afterwards . Then they initiated conversation inquiring of each other 's bodily anatomy , leading to a mutual decision to mate and procreate :",

    "context": "The United Nations ( UN ) is an intergovernmental organization tasked to promote international cooperation and to create and maintain international order . A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations , the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II with the aim of preventing another such conflict . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; there are now 193 . The headquarters of the UN is in Manhattan , New York City , and is subject to extraterritoriality . Further main offices are situated in Geneva , Nairobi , and Vienna . The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states . Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security , promoting human rights , fostering social and economic development , protecting the environment , and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine , natural disaster , and armed conflict . The UN is the largest , most familiar , most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organization in the world . The UN Charter was drafted at a conference between April -- June 1945 in San Francisco , and was signed on 26 June 1945 at the conclusion of the conference ; this charter took effect on 24 October 1945 , and the UN began operation . The UN 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the US and Soviet Union and their respective allies . The organization participated in major actions in Korea and the Congo , as well as approving the creation of the state of Israel in 1947 . The organization 's membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization in the 1960s , and by the 1970s its budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping . After the end of the Cold War , the UN took on major military and peacekeeping missions across the world with varying degrees of success .",

    "question": "what kind of meat comes from a goat",
    "context": "Goat meat or goat 's meat is the meat of the domestic goat ( Capra aegagrus hircus ) . Goat meat from adults is often called chevon and cabrito , capretto , or kid when it is from young animals . While `` goat '' is usually the name for the meat found in common parlance , producers and marketers may prefer to use the French - derived word chevon ( from chèvre ) , since market research in the United States suggests that `` chevon '' is more palatable to consumers than `` goat meat '' . Cabrito , a word of Spanish and Portuguese origin , refers specifically to young , milk - fed goat . In some parts of Asia , particularly India , Pakistan , Nepal , Sri Lanka and Bangladesh ; the word `` mutton '' is sometimes used to describe both goat and sheep meat , despite its more specific meaning ( limited to the meat of adult sheep ) in the UK , US , Australia and other English - speaking countries . Goat is a staple in Africa , Asia and South / Central America , and a delicacy in a few European cuisines . The cuisines best known for their use of goat include African cuisine , Middle Eastern , North African , Indian , Indonesian , Nepali , Pakistani , Mexican , and Caribbean ( Haiti ) .

    "context": "The designer of the approved Gill - man was Disney animator Milicent Patrick , though her role was deliberately downplayed by make - up artist Bud Westmore , who for half a century would receive sole credit for the creature 's conception . Jack Kevan , who worked on The Wizard of Oz ( 1939 ) and made prosthetics for amputees during World War II , created the bodysuit , while Chris Mueller Jr. sculpted the head . Ben Chapman portrayed the Gill - man for the majority of the scenes shot at Universal City , California . Many of the on - top of the water scenes were filmed at Rice Creek near Palatka , Florida . The costume made it impossible for Chapman to sit for the 14 hours of each day that he wore it , and it overheated easily , so he stayed in the back lot 's lake , often requesting to be hosed down . He also could not see very well while wearing the headpiece , which caused him to scrape Julie Adams ' head against the wall when carrying her in the grotto scenes . Ricou Browning played the Gill - Man in the underwater shots , which were filmed by the second unit in Wakulla Springs , Florida . Creature from the Black Lagoon received positive reviews from critics upon its release and is now considered a classic . Leonard Maltin awarded the film three out of a possible four stars , writing , `` Archetypal ' 50s monster movie has been copied so often that some of the edge is gone , but ... is still entertaining , with juicy atmosphere and luminous underwater photography sequences .

    "question": "who is the defense against the dark arts teacher",
    "context": "Transfiguration is essentially the art of changing the properties of an object . Transfiguration is a theory - based subject , including topics such as `` Switching Spells '' ( altering only a part of some object , such as when Hagrid gave Dudley a pig tail ) ; Vanishing Spells ( causing an object to completely disappear ) ; and Conjuring Spells ( creating objects out of thin air ) . It is possible to change inanimate objects into animate ones and vice versa -- Minerva McGonagall , the class 's teacher , transfigures her desk into a pig and back in Philosopher 's Stone . Defence Against the Dark Arts , commonly shortened to D.A.D.A. , is the class that teaches students defensive techniques to defend against the Dark Arts , and to be protected from Dark creatures . In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , with Death - Eaters in charge of the school , the subject is renamed the Dark Arts , and involves pupils practicing the Cruciatus Curse on those who have earned detentions . The subject has an extraordinarily high turnover of staff members -- throughout the series no Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher has retained the post for more than one school year . Harry is exceptionally skilled in this subject . During the period the story takes place , the class is taught by Quirinus Quirrell ( book one ) , Gilderoy Lockhart ( book two ) , Remus Lupin ( book three ) , Bartemius Crouch Jr impersonating Alastor `` Mad - eye '' Moody ( book four ) , Dolores Umbridge ( book five ) , Severus Snape ( book six ) , and Amycus Carrow ( book seven ) . Hagrid suggests in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets that `` They 're startin ' ter think the job 's jinxed . No one 's lasted long for a while now . '' In Half - Blood Prince , Dumbledore suggests that Voldemort cursed the position because his application for it was rejected . The existence of the jinx was eventually confirmed by Rowling . The position had also been coveted by Snape , but he was denied the position as well . Snape was finally appointed D.A.D.A. professor in Half - Blood Prince . Rowling announced in an interview that once Voldemort had died , the jinx he placed on the office was lifted and a permanent professor had been teaching the subject between the end of Deathly Hallows and the epilogue , set nineteen years afterwards . Furthermore , she imagines that Harry Potter occasionally comes to the class to give lectures on the subject . Charms is the class that teaches how to develop incantations for the uses of bewitchment . Rowling has described Charms as a type of magic spell concerned with giving an object new and unexpected properties . Charms classes are described as notoriously noisy and chaotic , as the lessons are largely practical . Many of the exposition sequences in the books are set in Charms classes , which are on the second floor of Hogwarts . The class is taught by Filius Flitwick .",

It 's funny -- nobody ever says anything to Woody Allen about always filming in New York . America has this great reverence for New York . I look at it as this decaying horror pit . So let the people in Chicago enjoy Ferris Bueller . '' For the film , Hughes got the chance to take a more expansive look at the city he grew up in . `` We took a helicopter up the Chicago River . This is the first chance I 'd really had to get outside while making a movie . Up to this point , the pictures had been pretty small . I really wanted to capture as much of Chicago as I could , not just the architecture and the landscape , but the spirit . '' Shooting began in Chicago on September 9 , 1985 . In late October 1985 , the production moved to Los Angeles , and shooting ended on November 22 . The Von Steuben Day Parade scene was filmed on September 28 . Scenes were filmed at several locations in downtown Chicago and Winnetka ( Ferris 's home , his mother 's real estate office , etc . ) . Many of the other scenes were filmed in Northbrook , Illinois , including at Glenbrook North High School , on School Drive , the long , curvy street on which Glenbrook North and neighboring Maple Middle School are situated . The exterior of Ferris 's house is located at 4160 Country Club Drive , Long Beach , California . The modernist house of Cameron Frye is located in Highland Park , Illinois . Known as the Ben Rose House , it was designed by architects A. James Speyer , who designed the main building in 1954 , and David Haid , who designed the pavilion in 1974 . It was once owned by photographer Ben Rose , who had a car collection in the pavilion . In the film Cameron 's father is portrayed as owning a Ferrari 250 GT California in the same pavilion . According to Lake Forest College art professor Franz Shulze , during the filming of the scene where the Ferrari crashes out of the window , Haid explained to Hughes that he could prevent the car from damaging the rest of the pavilion . Haid fixed connections in the wall and the building remained intact . Haid said to Hughes afterward , `` You owe me $25,000 '' , which Hughes paid . Other scenes were shot in Chicago , River Forest , Oak Park , Northbrook , Highland Park , Glencoe and Winnetka , Lake Forest and Long Beach , California . After Ben Rose 's death in 2009 the house was offered for sale and was sold in 2014 .",

    "question": "which three countries were known as the axis powers during world war ii",
    "context": "The Axis powers ( German : Achsenmächte ; Italian : Potenze dell'Asse ; Japanese : 枢軸 国 Sūjikukoku ) , also known as the Axis and the Rome -- Berlin -- Tokyo Axis , were the nations that fought in World War II against the Allied forces . The Axis powers agreed on their opposition to the Allies , but did not completely coordinate their activity . The Axis grew out of the diplomatic efforts of Germany , Italy , and Japan to secure their own specific expansionist interests in the mid-1930s . The first step was the treaty signed by Germany and Italy in October 1936 . Benito Mussolini declared on 1 November that all other European countries would from then on rotate on the Rome -- Berlin axis , thus creating the term `` Axis '' . The almost simultaneous second step was the signing in November 1936 of the Anti-Comintern Pact , an anti-communist treaty between Germany and Japan . Italy joined the Pact in 1937 . The `` Rome -- Berlin Axis '' became a military alliance in 1939 under the so - called `` Pact of Steel '' , with the Tripartite Pact of 1940 leading to the integration of the military aims of Germany , Italy and Japan . At its zenith during World War II , the Axis presided over territories that occupied large parts of Europe , North Africa , and East Asia . There were no three - way summit meetings and cooperation and coordination was minimal , with slightly more between Germany and Italy . The war ended in 1945 with the defeat of the Axis powers and the dissolution of their alliance . As in the case of the Allies , membership of the Axis was fluid , with some nations switching sides or changing their degree of military involvement over the course of the war .",

    "context": "In 1798 , Spain revoked the treaty allowing American use of New Orleans , greatly upsetting Americans . In 1801 , Spanish Governor Don Juan Manuel de Salcedo took over from the Marquess of Casa Calvo , and restored the American right to deposit goods . However , in 1800 Spain had ceded the Louisiana territory back to France as part of Napoleon 's secret Third Treaty of San Ildefonso . The territory nominally remained under Spanish control , until a transfer of power to France on November 30 , 1803 , just three weeks before the formal cession of the territory to the United States on December 20 , 1803 . A further ceremony was held in St. Louis , Upper Louisiana regarding the New Orleans formalities . The March 9 -- 10 , 1804 event is remembered as Three Flags Day . James Monroe and Robert R. Livingston had traveled to Paris to negotiate the purchase of New Orleans in January 1803 . Their instructions were to negotiate or purchase control of New Orleans and its environs ; they did not anticipate the much larger acquisition which would follow . The Louisiana Purchase was by far the largest territorial gain in U.S. history . Stretching from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains , the purchase doubled the size of the United States . Before 1803 , Louisiana had been under Spanish control for forty years . Although Spain aided the rebels in the American Revolutionary War , the Spanish did n't want the Americans to settle in their territory .",

It is primarily a solid ball with a radius of about 1,220 kilometres ( 760 miles ) , which is about 70 % of the Moon 's radius . It is composed of an iron -- nickel alloy and some light elements . The temperature at the inner core boundary is approximately 5700 K ( 5400 ° C ) . The Earth was discovered to have a solid inner core distinct from its liquid outer core in 1936 , by the Danish seismologist Inge Lehmann , who deduced its presence by studying seismograms from earthquakes in New Zealand . She observed that the seismic waves reflect off the boundary of the inner core and can be detected by sensitive seismographs on the Earth 's surface . This boundary is known as the Bullen discontinuity , or sometimes as the Lehmann discontinuity . A few years later , in 1940 , it was hypothesized that this inner core was made of solid iron ; its rigidity was confirmed in 1971 .",

He has been called `` one of the most innovative and influential American photographers ... '' and `` one of the masters of 20th century photography . '' Over the course of his 40 - year career Weston photographed an increasingly expansive set of subjects , including landscapes , still lives , nudes , portraits , genre scenes and even whimsical parodies . It is said that he developed a `` quintessentially American , and specially Californian , approach to modern photography '' because of his focus on the people and places of the American West . In 1937 Weston was the first photographer to receive a Guggenheim Fellowship , and over the next two years he produced nearly 1,400 negatives using his 8 × 10 view camera . Some of his most famous photographs were taken of the trees and rocks at Point Lobos , California , near where he lived for many years . Weston was born in Chicago and moved to California when he was 21 . He knew he wanted to be a photographer from an early age , and initially his work was typical of the soft focus pictorialism that was popular at the time . Within a few years , however , he abandoned that style and went on to be one of the foremost champions of highly detailed photographic images .",

The next day SAMCRO , with the help of Sean Casey , interrogates Liam O'Neill about his connection to Jimmy . O'Neill confesses that he blew up the truck that killed members of the Real IRA and SAMBEL . He also admits that McGee is working for Jimmy . After a shootout with Jimmy and his crew , Jax chases Jimmy but ca n't get to him in time . He makes it back just in time to watch Clay kill McGee for betraying the club . Later that night , Jax and the club meet with the IRA council to present the evidence that Jimmy has flipped and learns that it will not be he who kills Jimmy . Back at the clubhouse , Jax and Trinity come close to having sex , but Gemma and Maureen walk in on them . Jax learns from his mother that Trinity is his half - sister . He takes it well , even joking that in two more minutes he would have been in Tig 's territory . After talking to his mother , he meets with Father Ashby to find out where Abel is . Father Ashby admits that he never planned to give Abel back , because he knew of John Teller 's desire to keep Jax out of the life and decided if he could n't help Jax he could try to help Abel by giving him to a better family to raise him . Jax becomes furious and attacks Ashby , only to be thrown over a table . After Jax threatens to kill Sean Casey at gunpoint , Ashby then finally tells Jax where he can find Abel . However , Ashby tells Jax that if he loves Abel , he will let him go . When Jax finally finds Abel , his emotions and Ashby 's advice do n't allow him to decide whether to rescue Abel or leave him with his new adoptive family . Gemma is furious that Jax might give up her grandson , and she tells him that Tara is pregnant with a sibling for Abel . Jimmy O'Phelan kills the Irish adoptive parents and takes Abel hostage . After this happens , Jax decides he is done taking his father 's manuscript to heart and feels that if he never listened to Ashby , his son would n't be that situation . Jax and the Real IRA make a deal with Jimmy to trade Abel for a new hostage , Father Kellan Ashby . Right before leaving Belfast , Jax receives an undisclosed phone call from Tig , which might have been about Tara 's abduction . Once Jax and SAMCRO return from Belfast , they begin looking for Tara . The Mayans help in the search because Salazar is a threat to their new heroin operation in Stockton Prison . They find two women dead in the road . One is Salazar 's girlfriend and the other is a woman Salazar killed for her car . Jax is worried about Tara 's safety and Bobby promises him they will bring her back safely . They discover that Salazar not only has Tara , but has also taken Hale hostage . When Salazar reveals that he will trade Tara for Jax , he is ready and willing . Jax proceeds to get into a fight with Salazar . Salazar runs , only to end up cornered in the hall , where Jax stabs him to death and makes it look like self - defense . Later , he goes with Tara to have an ultrasound to make sure the baby is healthy . Jax later meets with Stahl , who is still determined to see the deal through . In the finale , it is revealed that his deal with Stahl was a club decision , and that he would never rat on his family . When she inevitably reneges on her promise of secrecy , he acts the part knowing she will soon be dead and they will serve light time . In a letter to Gemma , Jax assures her that he is not his father and would never rat on the club . However , Tara reads a letter from Jax 's father to his mistress Maureen Ashby , after the club is arrested , which strongly suggests that Gemma and Clay were responsible for John Teller 's death . Jax and the other club members are released from prison . He has abdominal scars stemming from a prison stabbing incident involving the Russian mob . Also , Jax 's appearance is different . He has cut his hair and trimmed his beard .",

    "question": "who wrote out here on my own from fame",
    "context": "`` Out Here on My Own '' is a ballad from the 1980 musical film Fame , performed by Irene Cara . It was written by sibling songwriting duo Lesley Gore ( lyricist ) and Michael Gore ( composer ) . The song was produced by Michael Gore , and published by MGM BMI / Variety ASCAP . Cara performed the song at the 1981 Academy Awards , where the song was nominated for Best Original Song . The song was released on the soundtrack to the 1980 film Fame , which also contains an instrumental version of the track . In its original review of the song in August 1980 , Billboard described Cara 's performance as `` a sensitive vocal reading with only acoustical keyboard supporting her graceful voice '' , and noted it was certain to impact `` pop and adult contemporary play '' . Ottawa Citizen described the song as `` showstopping '' . Upon the re-release of the soundtrack in 2003 , Chuck Taylor of Billboard wrote that the song `` remains as simplistic and memorable a statement of isolation as has ever been written '' . Dance Magazine wrote `` The lyrics to `` Fame '' , `` Out Here on My Own '' and `` I Sing the Body Electric '' became anthems for young performers following their passions `` . Comparing the 1980 film and 2009 reimagining , Today.com wrote that Naturi Naughton 's version is a `` gigantic and booming ... anthem for careerist kids determined to bulldoze their way into a multi-platform revenue stream deal with ICM '' , while in the original film `` Cara sings the song , gets told how good she is , then dismisses the entire thing by calling it ' sentimental s -- - ' '' .",

    "question": "when did the first episode of phineas and ferb air",
    "context": "Phineas and Ferb is an American animated musical comedy television series . Originally broadcast as a one - episode preview on August 17 , 2007 and again previewed on September 28 , 2007 , the series officially premiered on February 1 , 2008 on Disney Channel , and follows Phineas Flynn and his British stepbrother Ferb Fletcher on summer vacation . Every day , the boys embark on some grand new project , which annoys their controlling sister , Candace , who frequently tries to reveal their shenanigans to her and Phineas ' mother , Linda Flynn - Fletcher , and less frequently to Ferb 's father , Lawrence Fletcher . The series follows a standard plot system ; running gags occur every episode , and the b - plot almost always features Phineas and Ferb 's pet platypus Perry the Platypus working as a spy ( named `` Agent P '' ) for OWCA ( the Organization Without a Cool Acronym ) , to defeat the latest scheme of Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz , a mad scientist driven largely by a need to assert his evilness . Sometimes , other villains scoff at his level of evil . The two plots intersect at the end to erase all traces of the boys ' project just before Candace can show it to their mother . This usually leaves Candace very frustrated . Creators Dan Povenmire and Jeff `` Swampy '' Marsh had previously worked together on Fox 's The Simpsons and Nickelodeon 's Rocko 's Modern Life . The creators also voice two of the main B - plot characters : Major Monogram and Dr. Doofenshmirtz . Phineas and Ferb was conceived after Povenmire sketched a triangular boy -- the prototype for Phineas -- in a restaurant . Povenmire and Marsh developed the series concept together and pitched it to networks for 16 years before securing a run on Disney Channel .",

Originally , it ran 363 miles ( 584 km ) from Albany , on the Hudson River , to Buffalo , at Lake Erie . It was built to create a navigable water route from New York City and the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes . When completed in 1825 , it was the second longest canal in the world ( after the Grand Canal in China ) and greatly affected the development and economy of New York , New York City , and the United States . First proposed in the 1780s , then re-proposed in 1807 , a survey was authorized , funded , and executed in 1808 . Proponents of the project gradually wore down opponents ; its construction began in 1817 . The canal has 35 numbered locks , plus the Federal Black Rock Lock , and an elevation differential of about 565 feet ( 172 m ) . It opened on October 26 , 1825 .",

    "question": "where did they film the movie the mist",
    "context": "Darabont collaborated with the production designer to create a mix of eras to avoid appearing as a period piece but also not looking so contemporary . Cell phones were used by characters in The Mist , but the military police in the film did not dress in modern attire . While an MP also drove an old Jeep instead of a Humvee , other cars seen in the film are modern models . The city police cars in the beginning of the film are a 1987 Chevrolet Caprice and a 1988 Ford LTD Crown Victoria , cars that were standard police vehicles in the late 1980s but have not been used in force since the late 1990s . Over a hundred extras from Shreveport , Louisiana were included in The Mist . Unlike conventional application of extras in the background of a film , sixty of the hundred extras were interwoven with the film 's ensemble cast . Additional elements giving the film a local flavor include the prominence of local Louisiana brands such as Zapp 's potato chips . Exterior shots of the house at the beginning were in Shreveport . Exterior shots of the supermarket were in Vivian , Louisiana . Also , if looked closely at , the shields on the side of the passing firetrucks early in the film identify them as part of the Caddo Parish fire department . This is possibly a mistake as the film is allegedly set in Maine . Darabont chose to use music to minimal effect in The Mist in order to capture the `` heavier feel '' of the darker ending he had written to replace the one from the novella . The director explained , `` Sometimes movie music feels false . I 've always felt that silent can be scarier than loud , a whisper more frightening than a bang , and we wanted to create a balance . We kept music to a minimum to keep that vérité , documentary feel . '' Darabont chose to overlay the song `` The Host of Seraphim '' by the band Dead Can Dance , a spiritual piece characterized by wailing and chanting . As a fan of Dead Can Dance , Darabont thought that the song played `` as a requiem mass for the human race . '' The original score was composed by Academy Award - nominated composer Mark Isham .",

    "context": "This type of wave travels along a surface that is between two media . An example of a surface wave would be waves in a pool , or in an ocean , lake , or any other type of water body . There are two types of surface waves , namely Rayleigh waves and Love waves . Rayleigh waves , also known as ground roll , are waves that travel as ripples with motion similar to those of waves on the surface of water . Rayleigh waves are much slower than body waves , roughly 90 % of the velocity of body waves for a typical homogeneous elastic medium . A Love wave is a surface waves having horizontal waves that are shear or transverse to the direction of propagation . They usually travel slightly faster than Rayleigh waves , about 90 % of the body wave velocity , and have the largest amplitude .",

    "context": "`` Billy Do n't Be a Hero '' is a 1974 pop song that was first a UK hit for Paper Lace and then , some months later , a US hit for Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods . The song was written and composed by two British songwriters , Mitch Murray and Peter Callander . Because the song was released in 1974 , it was associated by some listeners with the Vietnam War , though the war to which it actually refers is never identified in the lyrics . It has been suggested that the drum pattern , references to a marching band leading soldiers in blue , and `` riding out '' ( cavalry ) refer to the American Civil War . However the drum beat and cavalry `` riding out '' is not specific to the American Civil War , and blue uniforms were common in the 19th century . That being said , Paper Lace themselves performed the song on Top of the Pops wearing Union - style uniforms , as can be seen on YouTube .",

    "context": "Unlike the earlier pilot , the comic - book origins of the character were emphasized by the retention of the character 's traditional uniform ( the design of which was interpreted and executed by Donald Lee Feld , credited as `` Donfeld '' ) with the original setting and through the use of comic book elements . The series 's title sequence was animated in the form of a series of comic book panels featuring Wonder Woman performing a variety of heroic feats . Within the show , location and exposition were handled through comic book - style text panels . Transitions between scenes and commercial breaks were marked by animated starburst sequences . In early 1942 , during the Second World War , American pilot Major Steve Trevor ( Waggoner ) bails out during an air battle over the Bermuda Triangle , location of Paradise Island . The island is home to the Amazons : beautiful , ageless women with great strength , agility , and intelligence . Amazon princess Diana ( Carter ) rescues the handsome unconscious Trevor and helps nurse him back to health . Her mother , the Amazon queen ( Cloris Leachman ; succeeded by Carolyn Jones and Beatrice Straight in later episodes ) , decrees that Olympic - style games shall be held to select one Amazon to return Trevor back to America . But she forbids her own daughter Diana , the princess , to participate . Diana states that since she is not allowed to participate , she does not want to be present for the games and will take a retreat to the other side of the island . The games are held with participants wearing masks and numbers , shown as Roman numerals in triangles on white sleeveless short tunic - dresses . Among the contestants is a blonde Amazon . During the events , the blonde Amazon shows exceptional skills and she ties for first with another Amazon . To break the deadlock , the `` bullets and bracelets '' event is decided as the tiebreaker , wherein each of the women takes turns shooting at the other ; the one being shot at must deflect the bullets with her bulletproof bracelets . The blond woman wins the event , superficially injuring her opponent 's arm . When she is pronounced the winner , she removes her mask and wig and reveals that she is Diana . Her mother , though initially shocked , relents and allows her to go to America . Diana 's uniform as Wonder Woman , designed by Queen Hippolyta , features emblems of America , the land to which she will be returning Steve Trevor . A golden belt will be the source of her strength and power while away from Paradise Island . She has her bullet - deflecting bracelets and also receives a golden lasso which is unbreakable and forces people to obey and tell the truth when bound with it . As shown later in flashback , Hippolyta also teaches Diana how to transform her clothes magically into the uniform .",

    "context": "The separation of powers , often imprecisely and metonymically used interchangeably with the trias politica principle , is a model for the governance of a state . Under this model , a state 's government is divided into branches , each with separate and independent powers and areas of responsibility so that the powers of one branch are not in conflict with the powers associated with the other branches . The typical division is into three branches : a legislature , an executive , and a judiciary , which is the trias politica model . It can be contrasted with the fusion of powers in some parliamentary systems where the executive and legislature are unified . Separation of powers , therefore , refers to the division of responsibilities into distinct branches to limit any one branch from exercising the core functions of another .

    "context": "Iron mining in the United States produced 42.5 million metric tons of iron ore in 2015 , worth US $3.8 billion . Iron ore was the third - highest - value metal mined in the United States , after gold and copper . Iron ore was mined from nine active mines and three reclamation operations in Michigan , Minnesota , and Utah . Most of the iron ore was mined in northern Minnesota 's Mesabi Range . Net exports ( exports minus imports ) were 3.9 million tons . US iron ore made up 2.5 percent of the total mined worldwide in 2015 . Employment as of 2014 was 5,750 in iron mines and iron ore treatment plants . US iron ore mining is dominated by the Precambrian banded iron formation deposits around Lake Superior , in Minnesota and Michigan ; such deposits were also formerly mined in Wisconsin . For the past 50 years , more than 90 percent of US iron ore production has been mined from the Lake Superior deposits . None of the iron ore now mined in the US is `` direct shipping '' ore ready to be fed into the iron - and steel - making process . The ore is concentrated to raise the iron content before use . All the iron ore currently mined is from open pits .",

'' After the events in chapters 32 and 33 , the LORD told Moses , `` Hew thee two tablets of stone like unto the first : and I will write upon these tablets the words that were in the first tablets , which thou brakest . '' `` And he wrote on the tablets , according to the first writing , the ten commandments , which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly : and the LORD gave them unto me . '' According to Jewish tradition , Exodus 20 : 1 -- 17 constitutes God 's first recitation and inscription of the ten commandments on the two tablets , which Moses broke in anger with his rebellious nation , and were later rewritten on replacement stones and placed in the ark of the covenant ; and Deuteronomy 5 : 4 -- 25 consists of God 's re-telling of the Ten Commandments to the younger generation who were to enter the Promised Land . The passages in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 contain more than ten imperative statements , totalling 14 or 15 in all . Different religious traditions divide the seventeen verses of Exodus 20 : 1 -- 17 and their parallels at Deuteronomy 5 : 4 -- 21 into ten `` commandments '' or `` sayings '' in different ways , shown in the table below . Some suggest that the number ten is a choice to aid memorization rather than a matter of theology .",

    "question": "where has the us manufacturing belt been traditionally located (specific cities)",
    "context": "In the 20th century , local economies in these states specialized in large - scale manufacturing of finished medium to heavy industrial and consumer products , as well as the transportation and processing of the raw materials required for heavy industry . The area was referred to as the Manufacturing Belt , Factory Belt , or Steel Belt as distinct from the agricultural Midwestern states forming the so - called Corn Belt and Great Plains states that are often called the `` bread - basket of America '' . The flourishing of industrial manufacturing in the region was caused in part by the close proximity to the Great Lakes waterways , and abundance of paved roads , water canals and railroads . After the transportation infrastructure linked the iron ore found in northern Minnesota , Wisconsin and Upper Michigan with the coal mined from Appalachian Mountains , the Steel Belt was born . Soon it developed into the Factory Belt with its great American manufacturing cities : Chicago , Buffalo , Detroit , Milwaukee , Cincinnati , Toledo , Cleveland , St. Louis , and Pittsburgh among others . This region for decades served as a magnet for immigrants from Austria - Hungary , Poland and Russia who provided the industrial facilities with inexpensive labor . Following several `` boom '' periods from the late - 19th to the mid-20th century , cities in this area struggled to adapt to a variety of adverse economic and social conditions . From 1979 to 1982 , the US Federal Reserve decided to raise the base interest rate in the United States to 19 % . High interest rates attracted wealthy foreign `` hot money '' into US banks and caused the US dollar to appreciate . This made US products more expensive for foreigners to buy and also made imports much cheaper for Americans to purchase . The misaligned exchange rate was not rectified until 1986 , by which time Japanese imports in particular had made rapid inroads into US markets . From 1987 to 1999 , the US stock market went into stratospheric rise , and this continued to pull wealthy foreign money into US banks , which biased the exchange rate against manufactured goods . Related issues include the decline of the iron and steel industry , the movement of manufacturing to the southeastern states with their lower labor costs , the layoffs due to the rise of automation in industrial processes , the decreased need for labor in making steel products , the internationalization of American business , and the liberalization of foreign trade policies due to globalization . Cities struggling with these conditions shared several difficulties , including population loss , lack of education , declining tax revenues , high unemployment and crime , drugs , swelling welfare rolls , deficit spending , and poor municipal credit ratings .",

    "context": "Poison dart frog ( also known as dart - poison frog , poison frog or formerly known as poison arrow frog ) is the common name of a group of frogs in the family Dendrobatidae which are native to tropical Central and South America . These species are diurnal and often have brightly colored bodies . This bright coloration is correlated with the toxicity of the species , making them aposematic . Some species of the family Dendrobatidae exhibit extremely bright coloration along with high toxicity , while others have cryptic coloration with minimal to no amount of observed toxicity . The species that have great toxicity derive this from their diet of ants , mites and termites . Other species however , that exhibit cryptic coloration and low to no amounts of toxicity , eat a much larger variety of prey . Many species of this family are threatened due to human infrastructure encroaching the places they inhabit . These amphibians are often called `` dart frogs '' due to the Amerindians ' indigenous use of their toxic secretions to poison the tips of blowdarts . However , of over 170 species , only four have been documented as being used for this purpose ( curare plants are more commonly used ) , all of which come from the genus Phyllobates , which is characterized by the relatively large size and high levels of toxicity of its members .",

While never released as a single , it remains a staple of their live shows and is usually played as the last song before the encore . It appeared in the feature film The Matrix , which increased the song 's exposure . The lyrics discuss racism within the American government and the counter-intelligence programs of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) ; a spoken portion of the song is taken from an actual FBI memo in which its director J. Edgar Hoover suggests targets for the suppression of the black nationalist movement . The song also makes references to prominent African - American figures targeted by the government such as Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. , and goes as far as saying that the government arranged their assassinations .

    "question": "list two of the main causes of the u.s. civil war",
    "context": "Historians debating the origins of the American Civil War focus on the reasons why seven Southern states declared their secession from the United States ( the Union ) , why they united to form the Confederate States of America ( or simply known as the `` Confederacy '' ) , and why the North refused to let them go . While most historians agree that conflicts over slavery caused the war , they disagree sharply regarding which kinds of conflict -- ideological , economic , political , or social -- were most important . The primary catalyst for secession was slavery , especially Southern political leaders ' resistance to attempts by Northern antislavery political forces to block the expansion of slavery into the western territories . Another explanation for secession , and the subsequent formation of the Confederacy , was white Southern nationalism . The primary reason for the North to reject secession was to preserve the Union , a cause based on American nationalism . Most of the debate is about the first question , as to why some southern states decided to secede . Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 presidential election without being on the ballot in ten Southern states . His victory triggered declarations of secession by seven slave states of the Deep South , whose riverfront or coastal economies were all based on cotton cultivated using slave labor . They formed the Confederate States of America after Lincoln was elected , but before he took office . Nationalists ( in the North and `` Unionists '' in the South ) refused to recognize the declarations of secession . No foreign country 's government ever recognized the Confederacy . The U.S. government under President James Buchanan refused to relinquish its forts that were in territory claimed by the Confederacy . The war itself began on April 12 , 1861 , when Confederate forces bombarded Fort Sumter , a major U.S. fortress in the harbor of Charleston , South Carolina .",

    "question": "where did you find the red pandas in india",
    "context": "The red panda is specialized as a bamboo feeder with strong , curved and sharp semi-retractile claws standing inward for grasping narrow tree branches , leaves , and fruit . Like the giant panda , it has a `` false thumb '' which is an extension of the wrist bone . When descending a tree head - first , the red panda rotates its ankle to control its descent , one of the few climbing species to do so . The red panda is endemic to the temperate forests of the Himalayas , and ranges from the foothills of western Nepal to China in the east . Its easternmost limit is the Qinling Mountains of the Shaanxi Province in China . Its range includes southern Tibet , Sikkim and Assam in India , Bhutan , the northern mountains of Burma , and in south - western China , in the Hengduan Mountains of Sichuan and the Gongshan Mountains in Yunnan . It may also live in south - west Tibet and northern Arunachal Pradesh , but this has not been documented . Locations with the highest density of red pandas include an area in the Himalayas that has been proposed as having been a refuge for a variety of endemic species in the Pleistocene . The distribution range of the red panda should be considered disjunct , rather than continuous . A disjunct population inhabits the Meghalaya Plateau of north - eastern India . During a survey in the 1970s , signs of red pandas were found in Nepal 's Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve . Their presence was confirmed in spring 2007 when four red pandas were sighted at elevations ranging from 3,220 to 3,610 m ( 10,560 to 11,840 ft ) . The species ' westernmost limit is in Rara National Park located farther west of the Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve . Their presence was confirmed in 2008 .",

    "question": "when did the jim crow law began and end",
    "context": "Jim Crow laws were state and local laws that enforced racial segregation in the Southern United States . Enacted by white Democratic - dominated state legislatures in the late 19th century after the Reconstruction period , these laws continued to be enforced until 1965 . They mandated racial segregation in all public facilities in the states of the former Confederate States of America , starting in 1896 with a `` separate but equal '' status for African Americans in railroad cars . Public education had essentially been segregated since its establishment in most of the South after the Civil War . This principle was extended to public facilities and transportation , including segregated cars on interstate trains and , later , buses . Facilities for African Americans were consistently inferior and underfunded compared to those which were then available to white Americans ; sometimes they did not exist at all . This body of law institutionalized a number of economic , educational , and social disadvantages . Segregation by law existed mainly in the Southern states , while Northern segregation was generally a matter of fact -- patterns of housing segregation enforced by private covenants , bank lending practices , and job discrimination , including discriminatory labor union practices . `` Jim Crow '' was a pejorative expression referring to a minstrel song called `` Jump Jim Crow '' by a performer appearing in blackface . Jim Crow laws -- sometimes , as in Florida , part of state constitutions -- mandated the segregation of public schools , public places , and public transportation , and the segregation of restrooms , restaurants , and drinking fountains for whites and blacks . The U.S. military was already segregated . President Woodrow Wilson , a Southerner , initiated segregation of federal workplaces at the request of southern Cabinet members in 1913 .",

    "context": "In the fiction of J.R.R. Tolkien , the Wizards of Middle - earth are a group of beings outwardly resembling Men but possessing much greater physical and mental power . They are also called the Istari ( Quenya for `` Wise Ones '' ) by the Elves . The Sindarin word is Ithryn ( sing . Ithron ) . They were sent by the Valar to assist the people of Middle - earth to contest Sauron . The wizards of Middle - earth were Maiar : spirits of the same order as the Valar , but lesser in power . The first three of these five wizards were known in the Mannish tongues of the Lord of the Rings series as Saruman `` man of skill '' ( Rohirric ) , Gandalf `` elf of the staff '' ( northern Men ) , and Radagast `` tender of beasts '' ( possibly Westron ) . Tolkien never provided non-Elvish names for the other two ; one tradition gives their names in Valinor as Alatar and Pallando , and another as Morinehtar and Rómestámo in Middle - earth . Each wizard in the series had robes of a characteristic colour : white for Saruman ( the chief and the most powerful of the five ) , grey for Gandalf , brown for Radagast , and sea - blue for Alatar and Pallando ( known consequently as the Blue Wizards ) . Gandalf and Saruman both play important roles in The Lord of the Rings , while Radagast appears only briefly . Alatar and Pallando do not feature in the story , as they are said to have journeyed far into the east after their arrival in Middle - earth . Tolkien gives multiple names for all of them . In Quenya , Saruman was Curumo ( `` skillful one '' ) ; Gandalf was Olórin ( `` dreaming '' or `` dreamer '' ) ; and Radagast was Aiwendil ( `` friend of birds '' ) . The Quenya names Morinehtar ( `` darkness - slayer '' ) and Rómestámo ( `` east - helper '' ) are given for Alatar and Pallando , though it is not clear which name goes with which wizard .

    "context": "In late 1966 , `` Sunday Morning '' was the final song to be recorded for The Velvet Underground & Nico . It was requested by Tom Wilson , who thought the album needed another song with lead vocals by Nico with the potential to be a successful single . The final master tape of side one of the album shows `` Sunday Morning '' only penciled in before `` I 'm Waiting for the Man '' . In November 1966 , Wilson brought the band into Mayfair Recording Studios in Manhattan . The song was written with Nico 's voice in mind by Lou Reed and John Cale on a Sunday morning . The band previously performed it live with Nico singing lead , but when it came time to record it , Lou Reed sang the lead vocal . Nico would instead sing backing vocals on the song . Aiming to create a hit for the album , `` Sunday Morning '' features noticeably more lush and professional production than the rest of the songs on the album . The song 's prominent use of celesta was the idea of John Cale , who noticed the instrument in the studio and decided to use it for the song . He also played viola and piano via overdubs and Sterling Morrison , normally the secondary guitarist , played bass , despite his dislike of the instrument .",

    "question": "what vitamin is produced by bacteria in the gut",
    "context": "In humans , the gut microbiota has the largest numbers of bacteria and the greatest number of species compared to other areas of the body . In humans , the gut flora is established at one to two years after birth , and by that time the intestinal epithelium and the intestinal mucosal barrier that it secretes have co-developed in a way that is tolerant to , and even supportive of , the gut flora and that also provides a barrier to pathogenic organisms . The relationship between some gut flora and humans is not merely commensal ( a non-harmful coexistence ) , but rather a mutualistic relationship . Some human gut microorganisms benefit the host by fermenting dietary fiber into short - chain fatty acids ( SCFAs ) , such as acetic acid and butyric acid , which are then absorbed by the host . Intestinal bacteria also play a role in synthesizing vitamin B and vitamin K as well as metabolizing bile acids , sterols , and xenobiotics . The systemic importance of the SCFAs and other compounds they produce are like hormones and the gut flora itself appears to function like an endocrine organ , and dysregulation of the gut flora has been correlated with a host of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions . The composition of human gut microbiota changes over time , when the diet changes , and as overall health changes . A systematic review from 2016 examined the preclinical and small human trials that have been conducted with certain commercially available strains of probiotic bacteria and identified those that had the most potential to be useful for certain central nervous system disorders .",

    "context": "In 1492 , a Spanish - based transatlantic maritime expedition led by Christopher Columbus encountered the Americas , a continent which was previously unknown in Europe , leading to the colonization of the Americas . For a very long time , it was believed that Columbus and his crew had been the first Europeans to make landfall in the Americas . However , they were not the first explorers from Europe to reach the Americas , having been preceded by the Viking expedition led by Leif Erikson in the 11th century ; however , Columbus 's voyages led to the first ongoing European contact with the Americas , inaugurating a period of exploration , conquest , and colonization that has lasted several centuries . Columbus was an Italian - born navigator sailing for the Crown of Castile in search of a westward route to Asia , to access the sources of spices and other oriental goods . This led to the discovery of a New World between Europe and Asia . Columbus made a total of four voyages to the Americas between 1492 and 1502 , setting the stage for the European exploration and colonization of the Americas , ultimately leading to the Columbian Exchange .",

    "context": "The Native American Party , renamed the American Party in 1855 and commonly known as the Know Nothing movement , was an American nativist political party that operated nationally in the mid-1850s . It was primarily anti-Catholic , xenophobic and hostile to immigration , starting originally as a secret society . The movement briefly emerged as a major political party in the form of the American Party . Adherents to the movement were to reply `` I know nothing '' when asked about its specifics by outsiders , thus providing the group with its common name . The Know Nothings believed a `` Romanist '' conspiracy was afoot to subvert civil and religious liberty in the United States and sought to politically organize native - born Protestants in the defense of traditional religious and political values . It is remembered for this theme because of fears by Protestants that Catholic priests and bishops would control a large bloc of voters . In most places , Know Nothingism lasted only a year or two before disintegrating because of weak local leaders , few publicly declared national leaders and a deep split over the issue of slavery . In the South , the party did not emphasize anti-Catholicism , but was the main alternative to the dominant Democratic Party .",

    "question": "what are the parts of a buckle called",
    "context": "Buckles remained exclusively for the wealthy until the 15th century where improved manufacturing techniques made it possible to easily produce a cheaper molded item available to the general population . The buckle essentially consists of four main components : the frame , chape , bar , and prong . The oldest Roman buckles are of a simple `` D '' - shaped frame , in which the prong or tongue extends from one side to the other . In the 14th century , buckles with a double - loop or `` 8 '' - shaped frame emerged . The prongs of these buckles attach to the center post . The appearance of multi-part buckles with chapes and removable pins , which were commonly found on shoes , occurred in the 17th century . The frame is the most visible part of the buckle and holds the other parts of the buckle together . Buckle frames come in various shapes , sizes , and decorations . The shape of the frame could be a plain square or rectangle , but may be oval or made into a circular shape . A reverse curve of the frame indicated that the whole buckle was intended to be used for securing a thick material , such as leather . This reverse curve shape made it easier to thread the intended thick material end over the bar . But the shape of the frame is not limited to simply squares and ovals , the decoration of the frame itself defines the shape it will turn out to be . Since the frame is the largest part of the buckle , any and all decorations are placed on it . Decorations range from wedged shapes , picture references to people and animals , and insignia of a desired organization .",

The last entrants are the Premier League and Championship clubs , into the draw for the Third Round Proper . In the modern era , only one non-league team has ever reached the quarter - finals , and teams below Level 2 have never reached the final . As a result , as well as who wins , significant focus is given to those `` minnows '' ( smaller teams ) who progress furthest , especially if they achieve an unlikely `` giant - killing '' victory . Winners receive the FA Cup trophy , of which there have been two designs and five actual cups ; the latest is a 2014 replica of the second design , introduced in 1911 . Winners also qualify for the Europa League and a place in the FA Community Shield match . Chelsea are the current holders , having beaten Manchester United 1 -- 0 in the 2018 final . Arsenal are the most successful club with 13 titles . Arsenal 's Arsène Wenger is the most successful manager in the competition with seven finals won . In 1863 , the newly founded Football Association ( the FA ) published the Laws of the Game of Association Football , unifying the various different rules in use before then . On 20 July 1871 , in the offices of The Sportsman newspaper , the FA Secretary C.W. Alcock proposed to the FA committee that `` it is desirable that a Challenge Cup should be established in connection with the Association for which all clubs belonging to the Association should be invited to compete '' . The inaugural FA Cup tournament kicked off in November 1871 . After thirteen games in all , Wanderers were crowned the winners in the final , on 16 March 1872 .

    "question": "what is the origin of the word cartoon",
    "context": "The concept originated in the Middle Ages and first described a preparatory drawing for a piece of art , such as a painting , fresco , tapestry , or stained glass window . In the 19th century , it came to refer to humorous illustrations in magazines and newspapers , and after the early 20th century , it referred to comic strips and animated films . A cartoon ( from Italian : cartone and Dutch : karton -- words describing strong , heavy paper or pasteboard ) is a full - size drawing made on sturdy paper as a study or modello for a painting , stained glass or tapestry . Cartoons were typically used in the production of frescoes , to accurately link the component parts of the composition when painted on damp plaster over a series of days ( giornate ) . Such cartoons often have pinpricks along the outlines of the design so that a bag of soot patted or `` pounced '' over the cartoon , held against the wall , would leave black dots on the plaster ( `` pouncing '' ) . Cartoons by painters , such as the Raphael Cartoons in London , and examples by Leonardo da Vinci , are highly prized in their own right . Tapestry cartoons , usually coloured , were followed with the eye by the weavers on the loom .",

    "question": "how many american teams are in the ohl",
    "context": "From 1974 until 1978 ( as the Ontario Major Junior Hockey League ) , Clarence `` Tubby '' Schmalz was the league 's commissioner . Then , for one season ( 1978 -- 79 ) , former IHL commissioner Bill Beagan served as commissioner of the OMJHL . Beginning with the 1979 - 80 season , David Branch has been the Commissioner of the OHL ( which became the league 's official name prior to the 1981 - 82 season ) . Branch was appointed on August 11 , 1979 , and assumed the commissioner 's role on September 17 , 1979 . Since 1980 the league has grown rapidly into a high - profile marketable product , with many games broadcast on television and radio . There are currently 20 teams in the OHL : 17 are based in the Canadian province of Ontario , two teams in the American state of Michigan , and one team in the American state of Pennsylvania . Leagues for ice hockey in Ontario were first organized in 1890 by the newly created Ontario Hockey Association ( OHA ) . In 1892 the OHA recognized junior hockey - referring to skill rather than age . In 1896 the OHA moved to the modern age - limited junior hockey concept , distinct from senior and intermediate divisions . Since then the evolution to the Ontario Hockey League has developed through four distinct eras of junior - aged non-professional hockey in Ontario . In 1933 , the junior division was divided into two levels , Junior A and Junior B. In 1970 the Junior A level was divided into two levels , Tier I ( or Major Junior A ) and Tier II ( or Minor Junior A ) . In 1974 the Tier I / Major Junior A group separated from the OHA and became the independent ' Ontario Major Junior Hockey League ' ( OMJHL ) . In 1980 , the OMJHL became the ' Ontario Hockey League .

    "question": "when did the nba start and how many teams were there",
    "context": "The Basketball Association of America was founded in 1946 by owners of the major ice hockey arenas in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Canada . On November 1 , 1946 , in Toronto , Ontario , Canada , the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens , in a game the NBA now refers to as the first played game in NBA history . The first basket was made by Ossie Schectman of the Knickerbockers . Although there had been earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues , including the American Basketball League and the NBL , the BAA was the first league to attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities . During its early years , the quality of play in the BAA was not significantly better than in competing leagues or among leading independent clubs such as the Harlem Globetrotters . For instance , the 1948 ABL finalist Baltimore Bullets moved to the BAA and won that league 's 1948 title , and the 1948 NBL champion Minneapolis Lakers won the 1949 BAA title . Prior to the 1948 -- 49 season , however , NBL teams from Fort Wayne , Indianapolis , Minneapolis , and Rochester jumped to the BAA , which established the BAA as the league of choice for collegians looking to turn professional . On August 3 , 1949 , the BAA absorbed the remainder of the NBL : Syracuse , Anderson , Tri-Cities , Sheboygan , Denver , and Waterloo . In deference to the merger and to avoid possible legal complications , the league name was changed from the BAA to the National Basketball Association in spite of having the same BAA governing body including Podoloff . The new league had seventeen franchises located in a mix of large and small cities , as well as large arenas and smaller gymnasiums and armories . In 1950 , the NBA consolidated to eleven franchises , a process that continued until 1953 -- 54 , when the league reached its smallest size of eight franchises : the New York Knicks , Boston Celtics , Philadelphia Warriors , Minneapolis Lakers , Rochester Royals , Fort Wayne Pistons , Tri-Cities Blackhawks , and Syracuse Nationals , all of which remain in the league today . The process of contraction saw the league 's smaller - city franchises move to larger cities . The Hawks shifted from the Tri-Cities to Milwaukee in 1951 , and then to St. Louis in 1955 . The Rochester Royals moved from Rochester , New York , to Cincinnati in 1957 and the Pistons relocated from Fort Wayne , Indiana , to Detroit in 1957 . Japanese - American Wataru Misaka broke the NBA color barrier in the 1947 -- 48 season when he played for the New York Knicks . He remained the only non-white player in league history prior to the first African - American , Harold Hunter , signing with the Washington Capitols in 1950 . Hunter was cut from the team during training camp , but several African - American players did play in the league later that year , including Chuck Cooper with the Celtics , Nathaniel `` Sweetwater '' Clifton with the Knicks , and Earl Lloyd with the Washington Capitols . During this period , the Minneapolis Lakers , led by center George Mikan , won five NBA Championships and established themselves as the league 's first dynasty . To encourage shooting and discourage stalling , the league introduced the 24 - second shot clock in 1954 . If a team does not attempt to score a field goal ( or the ball fails to make contact with the rim ) within 24 seconds of obtaining the ball , play is stopped and the ball given to its opponent .",

While the Ming walls are generally referred to as `` Great Wall '' ( changcheng ) in modern times , in Ming times they were called `` border barriers '' ( 邊 牆 ; bianqiang ) by the Chinese , since the term changcheng was said to evoke imagery of the tyranny of Qin Shi Huang ( 260 -- 210 BC ) .",

    "context": "The NASCAR points system has undergone several incarnations since its initial implementation . Originally , races awarded points by a complicated system based upon final positioning and weighted by prize money purses , such that higher - paying events gave more points . Soon after the advent of the modern era in 1972 , the championship was decided by a more basic cumulative point total based solely upon a driver 's finishing position in each race . In order to reduce the possibility of a driver clinching before the final event , NASCAR implemented the `` Chase for the Cup '' in 2004 which , with minor modification from 2004 to 2013 and more radical changes in 2014 , stands as the current format . Before the final ten races , 16 drivers , chosen primarily on race wins , are reset to an equal number of points , with bonus points awarded to a driver for each win prior to the reset . With these changes , the last Drivers ' Champion to clinch before the final race was Matt Kenseth in 2003 . Overall , thirty - two different drivers have won the Championship , with Richard Petty , Dale Earnhardt , and Jimmie Johnson hold the record for most titles at seven . Johnson has the record for most consecutive Drivers ' Championships , winning five from 2006 to 2010 . Thus far , every champion has originated from the United States .",

    "question": "who helped negotiate an alliance between the patriots and france",
    "context": "Motivated by the prospect of glory in battle or animated by the sincere ideals of liberty and republicanism , volunteers like Pierre Charles L'Enfant joined the American army . The most famous was Lafayette , a charming young aristocrat who defied the king 's order and enlisted in 1777 at age 20 . He became an aide to George Washington and a combat general . More importantly , he solidified a favorable American view of France . Kramer argues that Lafayette provided a legitimacy for the war and confidence that there was serious European support for independence . Lafayette 's personal style was highly attractive ; the young man learned quickly , adapted to the Patriot style , avoided politics , and became a fast friend of General Washington . Fifty years later , after a major career in French politics , he returned as a beloved hero of the war . Up against the British power , the young nation lacked arms and allies , and so it turned towards France . France was not directly interested in the conflict , but saw it as an opportunity to contest British power by supporting a new British opponent . Through negotiations conducted first by Silas Deane and then by Benjamin Franklin , France began covert support of the American cause . Secretly approached by Louis XVI and France 's foreign minister , the comte de Vergennes , Pierre Beaumarchais was authorized to sell gunpowder and ammunition to the Americans for close to a million pounds under the veil of the French company Rodrigue Hortalez et Compagnie . The aid given by France , much of which passed through the neutral Dutch West Indies port of Sint Eustatius , contributed to George Washington 's survival against the British onslaught in 1776 and 1777 . The aid was also a major factor in the defeat of General Burgoyne 's expedition in the Champlain corridor that ended in a British disaster at Saratoga . French ports accommodated American ships , including privateers and Continental Navy warships , that acted against British merchant ships . France provided significant economic aid , either as donations or loans , and also offered technical assistance , granting some of its military strategists `` vacations '' so they could assist American troops .",

    "question": "who has first introduced the concept of merit goods and when",
    "context": "The concept of a merit good introduced in economics by Richard Musgrave ( 1957 , 1959 ) is a commodity which is judged that an individual or society should have on the basis of some concept of need , rather than ability and willingness to pay . The term is , perhaps , less often used today than it was in the 1960s to 1980s but the concept still lies behind many economic actions by governments which are not performed specifically for financial reasons or by supporting incomes ( e.g. via tax rebates ) . Examples include the provision of food stamps to support nutrition , the delivery of health services to improve quality of life and reduce morbidity , subsidized housing and arguably education . In many cases , merit goods provide services which should apply universally to everyone in a particular situation , a view that is close to the concept of primary goods found in work by philosopher John Rawls or discussions about social inclusion . On the supply side , it is sometimes suggested that there will be more support in society for implicit redistribution via the provision of certain kinds of goods and services , rather than explicit redistribution through income . Alternatively , it is sometimes suggested that society in general may be in a better position to determine what individuals need ( such arguments are often criticised for being paternalistic , often by those who would like to reduce to a minimum economic activity by government ) .",

    "question": "corporate social responsibility (csr) is also known as",
    "context": "Corporate social responsibility ( CSR , also called corporate sustainability , sustainable business , corporate conscience , corporate citizenship or responsible business ) is a type of international private business self - regulation . While once it was possible to describe CSR as an internal organisational policy or a corporate ethic strategy , that time has passed as various international laws have been developed and various organisations have used their authority to push it beyond individual or even industry - wide initiatives . While it has been considered a form of corporate self - regulation for some time , over the last decade or so it has moved considerably from voluntary decisions at the level of individual organisations , to mandatory schemes at regional , national and even transnational levels . Considered at the organisational level , CSR is an organisational policy . As such , it must align with and be integrated into a business model to be successful . With some models , a firm 's implementation of CSR goes beyond compliance with regulatory requirements , and engages in `` actions that appear to further some social good , beyond the interests of the firm and that which is required by law '' . The choices of ' complying ' with the law , failing to comply , and ' going beyond ' are three distinct strategic organisational choices . While in many areas such as environmental or labor regulations , employers may choose to comply with the law , or go beyond the law , other organisations may choose to flout the law . These organisations are taking on clear legal risks . The nature of the legal risk , however , changes when attention is paid to soft law . Soft law may incur legal liability particularly when businesses make misleading claims about their sustainability or other ethical credentials and practices . Overall , businesses may engage in CSR for strategic or ethical purposes . From a strategic perspective , the aim is to increase long - term profits and shareholder trust through positive public relations and high ethical standards to reduce business and legal risk by taking responsibility for corporate actions . CSR strategies encourage the company to make a positive impact on the environment and stakeholders including consumers , employees , investors , communities , and others . From an ethical perspective , some businesses will adopt CSR policies and practices because of ethical beliefs of senior management . For example , a CEO may believe that harming the environment is ethically objectionable .",

    "question": "why does carbon dioxide increase in the body",
    "context": "Symptoms and signs of early hypercapnia include flushed skin , full pulse , tachypnea , dyspnea , extrasystoles , muscle twitches , hand flaps , reduced neural activity , and possibly a raised blood pressure . According to other sources , symptoms of mild hypercapnia might include headache , confusion and lethargy . Hypercapnia can induce increased cardiac output , an elevation in arterial blood pressure , and a propensity toward arrhythmias . Hypercapnia may increase pulmonary capillary resistance . In severe hypercapnia ( generally PaCO greater than 10 kPa or 75 mmHg ) , symptomatology progresses to disorientation , panic , hyperventilation , convulsions , unconsciousness , and eventually death . Hypercapnia is generally caused by hypoventilation , lung disease , or diminished consciousness . It may also be caused by exposure to environments containing abnormally high concentrations of carbon dioxide , such as from volcanic or geothermal activity , or by rebreathing exhaled carbon dioxide . It can also be an initial effect of administering supplemental oxygen on a patient with sleep apnea . In this situation the hypercapnia can also be accompanied by respiratory acidosis . Hypercapnia is generally defined as a blood gas carbon dioxide level over 45 mmHg . Since carbon dioxide is in equilibrium with carbonic acid in the blood , hypercapnia can drive serum pH down , resulting in a respiratory acidosis . Clinically , the effect of hypercapnia on pH is estimated using the ratio of the arterial pressure of carbon dioxide to the concentration of bicarbonate ion , P CO / ( HCO ) .",

    "context": "A search warrant is a court order that a magistrate , judge or Supreme Court official issues to authorize law enforcement officers to conduct a search of a person , location , or vehicle for evidence of a crime and to confiscate any evidence they find . In most countries a search warrant can not be issued in aid of civil process . Jurisdictions that respect the rule of law and a right to privacy constrain police powers , and typically require search warrants or an equivalent procedure for searches police conducted in the course of a criminal investigation . The laws usually make an exception for hot pursuit : a police officer following a criminal who has fled the scene of a crime has the right to enter a property where the criminal has sought shelter . This contrasts with authoritarian regimes , where police typically can search property and people without having to provide justification or secure court permission .",

    "question": "who sang the original baby it's cold outside",
    "context": "Loesser originally created it to sing with his wife , Lynn Garland , as a private performance for their friends . It was later recorded for the film Neptune 's Daughter , it has been recorded by many artists since its original release , including Ray Charles , Dolly Parton and Michael Bublé . Loesser wrote the duet in 1944 and premiered the song with his wife , Lynn Garland , at their Navarro Hotel in New York housewarming party , and performed it toward the end of the evening , signifying to guests that it was nearly time to end the party . Loesser would introduce himself as the `` Evil of Two Loessers '' , a play on the theme of the song , trying to keep the girl from leaving , and on the phrase `` lesser of two evils '' . This was a period when the Hollywood elite 's chief entertainment was throwing parties and inviting guests who were expected to perform . Garland wrote that after the first performance , `` We become instant parlor room stars . We got invited to all the best parties for years on the basis of ' Baby . ' It was our ticket to caviar and truffles . Parties were built around our being the closing act . '' Garland considered it their song and was furious when Loesser told her he was selling the song . Garland wrote , `` I felt as betrayed as if I 'd caught him in bed with another woman . '' The lyrics in this duet are designed to be heard as a conversation between two people , identified as `` mouse '' ( usually female ) and `` wolf '' ( usually male ) on the printed score ; they are at the wolf 's home and the mouse decides it is time to go home , but the wolf flirtatiously invites the mouse to stay as it is late and `` it 's cold outside . '' The mouse states that he / she has enjoyed the time and agrees at one point to another drink , but the mouse also says `` the answer is no '' and tries to return home , worried what family and neighbors will think . Every line in the song features a statement from the mouse followed by a response from the wolf , which is musically known as a call and response song .",

Santa Anna , the President of Mexico , was captured the following day and held as a prisoner of war . Three weeks later , he signed the peace treaty that dictated that the Mexican army leave the region , paving the way for the Republic of Texas to become an independent country . These treaties did not specifically recognize Texas as a sovereign nation , but stipulated that Santa Anna was to lobby for such recognition in Mexico City . Sam Houston became a national celebrity , and the Texans ' rallying cries from events of the war , `` Remember the Alamo !

    "context": "The pilot episode was initially filmed on location in Northern Ireland , Scotland and Morocco by Tom McCarthy between October 24 and November 19 , 2009 . However , the pilot was deemed unsatisfactory and much of it had to be reshot together with the other episodes of the season in Northern Ireland and Malta . Most scenes were shot in Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland border counties . Principal photography was scheduled to begin on July 26 , 2010 , with the primary studio location being the Paint Hall Studio in the Titanic Quarter of Belfast , Northern Ireland . Among various locations for the initial shooting of the pilot in 2009 , Doune Castle in central Scotland was used as the location for Winterfell , including scenes at its great hall ( the great hall was later recreated in a soundstage in Northern Ireland ) . Additional filming locations included Cairncastle at Larne , Shane 's Castle , and Tollymore Forest Park , all in Northern Ireland . In the 2010 shooting of the series , Castle Ward was used as Winterfell instead of Doune Castle , with Cairncastle for some exterior Winterfell scenes . The set for Castle Black was built at Magheramorne quarry . The show 's presence in Northern Ireland and use of Paint Hall created hundreds of jobs for residents , and made the area `` a hub for film and television production '' . The `` King 's Landing '' exterior scenes were shot at various locations in Malta , including the city of Mdina and the island of Gozo . The filming in Malta resulted in controversy when a protected ecosystem was damaged by a subcontractor .",

    "context": "`` It Might as Well Rain Until September '' is a 1962 song originally written for Bobby Vee by Carole King and Gerry Goffin . King recorded the demo version of the song and it became a hit for her . However , Vee 's management baulked at releasing the song as a single , instead using it only as an album track . Bobby Vee recorded the song the same year for his 1963 Liberty album The Night Has a Thousand Eyes . The song was written by Carole King and Gerry Goffin and intended for Bobby Vee , for whom they had already written the song `` Take Good Care of My Baby '' , a number one hit in the United States in 1961 and which remains Vee 's biggest hit on the Billboard Hot 100 . King recorded the demo version of the song and this version was released as a double A-side single with `` Nobody 's Perfect '' . Although she had recorded earlier for ABC - Paramount and Alpine Records , ' ... September ' was Carole King 's first commercial success as a singer , having already had a number of hits as a songwriter . The recording was only ever intended as a demo , and as such there is no master tape , only an acetate . This is the reason why all digital releases of this recording are of inferior quality compared to other songs of this era . However , Don Kirshner liked Carole King 's version of `` September '' so much that even after hearing Bobby Vee 's version , he decided to release King 's version as a single on the Dimension label . Carole King had two small children and did not have any interest in traveling the country to promote the record . Despite this , Carole King was ultimately persuaded by Don Kirshner and Gerry Goffin to appear on Dick Clark 's American Bandstand , where King lip - synched to the record ( as was almost always done on the show ) and , unlike many other performers who were given good ratings , was given a terrible rating of a 42 out of 100 by the Bandstand kids . While King was devastated by the terribly - rated performance , the song still became popular .",

    "question": "what two types of crust make up the surface of the earth",
    "context": "In geology , the crust is the outermost solid shell of a rocky planet , dwarf planet or natural satellite , which is chemically distinct from the underlying mantle . The crusts of Earth , Moon , Mercury , Venus , Mars , Io , and other planetary bodies have been generated largely by igneous processes , and these crusts are richer in incompatible elements than their respective mantles . The Earth 's crust is composed of distinctly different continental crust and oceanic crust , which have different chemical compositions and physical properties , and which were formed by different geological processes . The crust of the Earth is composed of a great variety of igneous , metamorphic , and sedimentary rocks . The crust is underlain by the mantle . The upper part of the mantle is composed mostly of peridotite , a rock denser than rocks common in the overlying crust . The boundary between the crust and mantle is conventionally placed at the Mohorovičić discontinuity , a boundary defined by a contrast in seismic velocity . The crust occupies less than 1 % of Earth 's volume .",

    "context": "The Panama Canal ( Spanish : Canal de Panamá ) is an artificial 77 km ( 48 mi ) waterway in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean . The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a key conduit for international maritime trade . There are locks at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake , an artificial lake created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal , 26 m ( 85 ft ) above sea level , and then lower the ships at the other end . The original locks are 34 m ( 110 ft ) wide . A third , wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016 . The expanded canal began commercial operation on June 26 , 2016 . The new locks allow transit of larger , Post-Panamax ships , capable of handling more cargo . France began work on the canal in 1881 but stopped due to engineering problems and a high worker mortality rate . The United States took over the project in 1904 and opened the canal on August 15 , 1914 . One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken , the Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduced the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans , enabling them to avoid the lengthy , hazardous Cape Horn route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage or Strait of Magellan .",

    "context": "Just for Laughs : Gags ( in French , Juste pour rire : Gags ) is a Canadian silent comedy / hidden camera reality television show that is under the Just for Laughs brand . It is based on the similar American series Candid Camera . The series is also on YouTube . In December 26 , 2000 , JFL : Gags began airing on French Canadian network Canal D. In the following years , the show was picked up by TVA , CBC and The Comedy Network in Canada , BBC1 in the UK , TF1 in France and ABC and Telemundo in the United States ; the Canadian version ( unlike the ones produced for ABC ) aired in the United States in first - run syndication starting in the fall of 2015 and ended in February 2016 . The series uses a hidden camera format , playing pranks on unsuspecting subjects while hidden cameras capture the subjects ' responses ; each episode presents multiple gags . While some segments have included brief dialogue , most do not contain any sound or dialogue ; the audio is replaced with sound effects , a laugh track , and public domain music . Most segments are filmed in Quebec City , Montreal and Vancouver , while some have been filmed in Mexico . British and Asian versions have been produced in the UK and Singapore , respectively . In 2011 the show spawned a spinoff , Just Kidding , which consists exclusively of kids playing pranks on adults . With its silent format and no translation required , Just for Laughs : Gags has been purchased for use in over 100 countries throughout the world as well as in airports and by airlines . Reactions to the gags range from `` inane '' to cross-culturally funny . The same distributors also distribute Surprise Sur Prise , a similar show .",

Groundbreaking for the building was held on August 11 , 1962 . The original building contained just two rooms , and 19,000 square feet ( 1,800 m ) of interior space . In April 1970 , ground was broken for the first of many expansions . This first expansion cost $ 620,000 , and was completed in May 1971 . The size was increased to 34,000 square feet ( 3,200 m ) by adding another room . The pro shop opened with this expansion . This was also an important milestone for the Pro Football Hall of Fame , as yearly attendance passed the 200,000 mark for the first time . This was at least in some part due to the increase in popularity of professional football caused by the advent of the American Football League and its success in the final two AFL - NFL World Championship games .",

A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon 's apparent diameter is larger than the Sun 's , blocking all direct sunlight , turning day into darkness . Totality occurs in a narrow path across Earth 's surface , with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide . The central shadow of the moon passed through the American states of Washington , Oregon , Idaho , Montana ( where totality covered almost the entire state ) , and North Dakota , the Canadian provinces Saskatchewan , Manitoba , Ontario , and Quebec , the Northwest Territories of Canada ( the portion that is now Nunavut ) , and Greenland . Many visitors traveled to the Pacific Northwest to view the Monday morning eclipse , as it was the last chance to view a total solar eclipse in the contiguous United States for almost four decades .

He sites the Kachina dance songs as the most complex songs and Hopi and Zuni material as the most complex of the Pueblo , while Tanoan and Keresan music is simpler and intermediate between the Plains and western Pueblos . The music of the Pima and Tohono O'odham is intermediary between the Plains - Pueblo and the California - Yuman music areas , with melodic movement of the Yuman , though including the rise , and the form and rhythm of the Pueblo . He describes Southern Athabascan music , that of the Apache and Navajo , as the simplest next to the Great Basin style , featuring strophic form , tense vocals using pulsation and falsetto , tritonic and tetratonic scales in triad formation , simple rhythms and values of limited duration ( usually only two per song ) , arc - type melodic contours , and large melodic intervals with a predominance of major and minor thirds and perfect fourths and fifths with octave leaps not rare . Peyote songs share characteristics of Apache music and Plains - Pueblo music having been promoted among the Plains by the Apache people . He describes the structural characteristics of California - Yuman music , including that of Pomo , Miwak , Luiseno , Catalineno , and Gabrielino , and the Yuman tribes , including , Mohave , Yuman , Havasupai , Maricopa , as using the rise in almost all songs , a relaxed nonpulsating vocal technique ( like European classical music ) , a relatively large amount of isorhythmic material , some isorhythmic tendencies , simple rhythms , pentatonic scales without semitones , an average melodic range of an octave , sequence , and syncopated figures such as a sixteenth - note , eight - note , sixteenth - note figure . The form of rise used varies throughout the area , usually being rhythmically related to the preceding non-rise section but differing in melodic material or pitch . The rise may be no higher than the highest pitch of the original section , but will contain a much larger number of higher pitches . In California the non-rise is usually one reiterate phrase , the rise being the phrase transposed an octave higher , the Yumans use a non-rise of long repeated sections each consisting of several phrases , the rise being three to five phrases performed only once , and in southern California the previous two and progressive forms are found .",

    "question": "what are the two methods of proposing an amendment to the constitution",
    "context": "Article Five of the United States Constitution describes the process whereby the Constitution , the nation 's frame of government , may be altered . Altering the Constitution consists of proposing an amendment or amendments and subsequent ratification . Amendments may be proposed either by the Congress with a two - thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate or by a convention of states called for by two - thirds of the state legislatures . To become part of the Constitution , an amendment must be ratified by either -- as determined by Congress -- the legislatures of three - quarters of the states or state ratifying conventions in three - quarters of the states . The vote of each state ( to either ratify or reject a proposed amendment ) carries equal weight , regardless of a state 's population or length of time in the Union . Additionally , Article V temporarily shielded certain clauses in Article I from being amended . The first clause in Section 9 , which prevented Congress from passing any law that would restrict the importation of slaves prior to 1808 , and the fourth clause in that same section , a declaration that direct taxes must be apportioned according to state populations , were explicitly shielded from Constitutional amendment prior to 1808 . It also shields the first clause of Article I , Section 3 , which provides for equal representation of the states in the Senate , from being amended , though not absolutely .",

    "context": "The film received positive reviews from critics , and was nominated for four Academy Awards : Best Picture , Best Supporting Actor for Michael Clarke Duncan , Best Sound , and Best Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published . In a Louisiana assisted - living home in 1999 , Paul Edgecomb begins to cry while watching the film Top Hat . His companion Elaine becomes concerned , and Paul explains to her that the film reminded him of the events of 1935 , which took place when he was a prison officer , in charge of death row , what they refer to as the `` Green Mile '' . In 1935 , Paul supervises officers Brutus Howell , Dean Stanton , Harry Terwilliger , and Percy Wetmore at Cold Mountain Penitentiary . Paul is suffering from a severe bladder infection and receives John Coffey , a physically imposing but mentally challenged black man , into his custody . John had been sentenced to death after being convicted of raping and murdering two white girls . One of the other inmates is a Native - American named Arlen Bitterbuck , who is charged with murder and is the first to be executed . Percy demonstrates a severe sadistic streak , but , as the nephew of Louisiana 's First Lady , he can not be held to account . He is particularly abusive with inmate Eduard Delacroix ; he breaks Del 's fingers with his baton , steps on a pet mouse named Mr. Jingles , which Del had adopted , repeatedly calls him by a gay slur , and ultimately sabotages his execution by failing to soak the sponge used to conduct electricity to Del 's head ; as a result Del suffers a much more painful and graphic death by catching fire .",

The film had a limited release on December 17 , 1993 and wide release on March 4 , 1994 . The wide release garnered $2,104,938 on its first weekend . Total domestic gross for the film was $10,032,765 . The film received positive reviews from critics . On Rotten Tomatoes , the film was given an 89 % `` Certified Fresh '' rating . The New York Times film critic Janet Maslin praised DiCaprio 's performance , writing `` the film 's real show - stopping turn comes from Mr. DiCaprio , who makes Arnie 's many tics so startling and vivid that at first he is difficult to watch ... The performance has a sharp , desperate intensity from beginning to end . '' Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun - Times described it as `` ... one of the most enchanting films of the year '' and said that DiCaprio deserved to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for which he was nominated . Todd McCarthy of Variety found the film a `` bemused view on life '' and remarked that `` Depp manages to command center screen with a greatly affable , appealing characterization . '' The Washington Post 's Desson Howe thought the film was an earnest but highly predictable effort .

It is a song about two lovers who have drifted apart while they `` go through the motions '' and heartache of life together . The song was written by Neil Diamond with Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman for the ill - fated TV show All That Glitters . The song was intended to be the theme song , but Norman Lear changed the concept of the show and the song was no longer appropriate . Diamond then expanded the track from 45 seconds to 3 : 17 , adding instrumental sections and an additional verse . The Bergmans contributed to the song 's lyrics . In 1977 , Diamond released the album I 'm Glad You 're Here with Me Tonight , which included the track `` You Do n't Bring Me Flowers '' as a solo performance . Early in 1978 , Barbra Streisand covered the song on her album Songbird .",

    "question": "what type of mutation produces the bcr-abl chimeric protein",
    "context": "Fusion proteins or chimeric ( \\ kī - ˈmir - ik ) proteins ( literally , made of parts from different sources ) are proteins created through the joining of two or more genes that originally coded for separate proteins . Translation of this fusion gene results in a single or multiple polypeptides with functional properties derived from each of the original proteins . Recombinant fusion proteins are created artificially by recombinant DNA technology for use in biological research or therapeutics . Chimeric or chimera usually designate hybrid proteins made of polypeptides having different functions or physico - chemical patterns . Chimeric mutant proteins occur naturally when a complex mutation , such as a chromosomal translocation , tandem duplication , or retrotransposition creates a novel coding sequence containing parts of the coding sequences from two different genes . Naturally occurring fusion proteins are commonly found in cancer cells , where they may function as oncoproteins . The bcr - abl fusion protein is a well - known example of an oncogenic fusion protein , and is considered to be the primary oncogenic driver of chronic myelogenous leukemia . Some fusion proteins combine whole peptides and therefore contain all functional domains of the original proteins . However , other fusion proteins , especially those that occur naturally , combine only portions of coding sequences and therefore do not maintain the original functions of the parental genes that formed them .",

    "question": "where did the great western cattle trail begin and end",
    "context": "The Great Western Trail went west of and roughly parallel to the Chisholm Trail into Kansas . The cattle were taken to towns which were located on major railroads and delivered north to establish ranches . Although rail lines were built in Texas , the cattle drives continued north because of Texas rail prices , it was more profitable to trail them north . The Great Western Cattle Trail was first traveled by Captain John T. Lytle in 1874 when he was transporting 3,500 longhorn cattle up from Southern Texas into Nebraska . In five short years , it became one of the most traveled and famous Cattle Trails in U.S. history . Despite its popularity , traffic along the trail began to decline in 1885 due to the spreading use of barbed wire fences and the legislation calling for a quarantine of Texas cattle due to the `` Texas Fever '' - a disease spread by a parasitic tick . The last major Cattle drive up the trail was on its way to Deadwood , South Dakota in 1893 . By that time there had been an estimated six to seven million cattle and one million horses that had traversed the trail . Later , in order to commemorate the significance of the Cattle Drive era , two markers were erected in the 1930s at Doan 's . Doan 's was seen as the last `` stepping - off point '' before entering Indian Territory that sold supplies , ammo , tobacco , provisions , Stetson hats & guns , and anything else that would be required on the long trek . C.E. Doan had kept a meticulous record of the companies and Trail Bosses along with the number of cattle that crossed his path each year , allowing for numbers and history to be preserved , so a marker was fitting . In 2003 a new project was launched in order to place cement markers every six to ten miles along the trail , from the Rio Grande to Ogallala , Nebraska . Oklahoma set the first post south of the city at Altus . Texas placed its first marker at the Doan 's Adobe house during the 121st Doan 's May Day Picnic of 2005 . The picnic was first held in 1884 on the first Saturday of May at the now ghost town of Doans , north of Vernon , Texas . A barbecue lunch and T - shirts are available for sale , and a king and queen are crowned at the event . One of the shirts for 2017 features a design by Harold Dow Bugbee , former curator of the Panhandle - Plains Historical Museum in Canyon , Texas , which depicts longhorns and a cowboy crossing the Red River at Doan 's Crossing . There the postmaster Corwin F. Doan ( 1848 - 1929 ) also operated a store to supply the cowboys . Bugbee 's sculpture is part of the 1931 Trail Drivers Monument at Doans . During the event , riders cross the river each year from Oklahoma and usually arrive just before noon . The adobe house , built in 1881 , is the oldest in Wilbarger County and is open for tours during the picnic .",

The drink grew out of an orange juice stand opened in Los Angeles , California in 1926 by Julius Freed . Sales were initially modest , about $20 a day ( equivalent to approximately $276 in 2017 dollars ) . In 1929 , Bill Hamlin , Freed 's real estate broker , developed a mixture that made the acidic orange juice less bothersome to his stomach . Freed 's stand began serving the drink , which had a frothier , creamier texture . The sales at the stand increased substantially after the introduction of the new drink , going up to $100 a day .

    "context": "The Olympic motto is the hendiatris Citius , Altius , Fortius , which is Latin for `` Faster , Higher , Stronger '' . It was proposed by Pierre de Coubertin upon the creation of the International Olympic Committee in 1894 . Coubertin borrowed it from his friend Henri Didon , a Dominican priest who was an athletics enthusiast . Coubertin said `` These three words represent a programme of moral beauty . The aesthetics of sport are intangible . '' The motto was introduced in 1924 at the Olympic Games in Paris . A more informal but well - known motto , also introduced by Coubertin , is `` The most important thing is not to win but to take part ! '' Coubertin got this motto from a sermon by the Bishop of Pennsylvania during the 1908 London Games . The rings are five interlocking rings , coloured blue , yellow , black , green , and red on a white field , known as the `` Olympic rings '' . The symbol was originally designed in 1912 by de Coubertin . He appears to have intended the rings to represent the five participating continents : Africa , Asia , America , Oceania and Europe . According to Coubertin , the colours of the rings together with the white of the background included the colours composing every competing nation 's flag at the time . Upon its initial introduction , Coubertin stated the following in the August 1912 edition of Olympique : ... the six colours ( including the flag 's white background ) combined in this way reproduce the colours of every country without exception . The blue and yellow of Sweden , the blue and white of Greece , the tricolour flags of France , England , the United States , Germany , Belgium , Italy and Hungary , and the yellow and red of Spain are included , as are the innovative flags of Brazil and Australia , and those of ancient Japan and modern China . This , truly , is an international emblem .",

    "question": "where are the future summer olympics being held",
    "context": "This is a list of host cities of the Olympic Games , both summer and winter , since the modern Olympics began in 1896 . Since then , summer games have usually -- but not always -- celebrated a four - year period known as an Olympiad . There have been 28 Summer Olympic Games held in 23 cities , and 22 Winter Olympic Games held in 19 cities . In addition , three summer and two winter editions of the Games were scheduled to take place but later cancelled due to war : Berlin ( summer ) in 1916 ; Tokyo / Helsinki ( summer ) and Sapporo / Garmisch - Partenkirchen ( winter ) in 1940 ; and London ( summer ) and Cortina d'Ampezzo , Italy ( winter ) in 1944 . The 1906 Summer Olympics were officially sanctioned and held in Athens . However , in 1949 , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) , decided to unrecognize the 1906 Games . Five cities have been chosen by the IOC to host upcoming Olympic Games : Pyeongchang for the 2018 Winter Olympics , Tokyo for the 2020 Summer Olympics , Beijing for the 2022 Winter Olympics , Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics , and Los Angeles for the 2028 Summer Olympics . In 2022 , Beijing will become the only city that has held both the summer and the winter Olympic Games . Seven cities have hosted the Olympic Games more than once : Athens ( 1896 and 2004 Summer Olympics ) , Paris ( 1900 , 1924 , and 2024 Summer Olympics ) , London ( 1908 , 1948 , and 2012 Summer Olympics ) , St. Moritz ( 1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics ) , Lake Placid ( 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics ) , Los Angeles ( 1932 , 1984 , and 2028 Summer Olympics ) , and Innsbruck ( 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics ) . Tokyo will join this list upon hosting the 2020 Summer Olympics , having previously hosted the summer games of 1964 , as well as Beijing upon hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics , having previously hosted the summer games of 2008 . In addition , Stockholm hosted the 1912 Summer Olympics and the equestrian portion of the 1956 Summer Olympics . London became the first city to have hosted three Games with the 2012 Summer Olympics . Paris will become the second city to do this with the 2024 Summer Olympics , followed by Los Angeles as the third in 2028 . The United States has hosted a total of eight Olympic Games , more than any other country , followed by France with five editions . Canada , Germany , Italy , Japan , and the United Kingdom have each hosted three Games .",

    "question": "where does i am princess x take place",
    "context": "I Am Princess X is a 2015 book by Cherie Priest . It first published on May 26 , 2015 through Arthur A. Levine Books and its story is told through a hybrid of traditional novel and graphic novel formats . The work is not related to the 1916 sculpture Princess X by Constantin Brâncuși . May is a lonely teenager living in Atlanta with her mother but spends summers in Seattle with her father . Years ago , before her parents divorced and they all lived in Seattle , she and her best friend Libby worked together to create the fictional character named Princess X , a warrior - princess that went through whatever adventures the two of them could dream up . This all came to an end when Libby died in a car accident on the Ballard Bridge . Now in present day , May begins seeing stickers and other memorabilia that showcase Princess X during the summer before her 17th birthday . She 's directed to a website containing stories of Princess X 's exploits , all of which are similar to the stories May wrote years earlier . This leads May to wonder if Libby is still alive . She decides to follow a series of clues left by the people responsible for the website , however as she progresses she discovers that she is not the only person looking for Libby . As the book progresses May discovers that Libby is indeed alive and that she was actually kidnapped by a man who wanted Libby 's parents to allow her to be used as part of a medical procedure to save his own daughter . They refuse due to the risk of Libby 's own health and well - being , only for the man to murder them and steal Libby away to raise in the place of his own daughter , who died soon after he was turned away . Libby managed to escape but had to remain continually on the run , as the man kept searching for her and lied to authorities , saying that she was his mentally unhinged daughter . The book ends with May and Libby reuniting and the end of her captor 's attempts to kidnap her . Critical reception for I Am Princess X has been positive . MuggleNet praised the book and wrote `` The plot 's no Gordian knot , but Priest 's readable style , and the incorporation of a Princess X webcomic into the text itself , keeps you from getting bored with this story . I Am Princess X is pure fun and a much - needed addition to the canon of YA literature for girls who like Reddit and superheroes . '' Geeks of Doom also wrote a favorable review , commenting that the book 's only flaw was that `` while it is a perfect read for the female 12 and up set , younger boys might not be interested solely because of the title . But that might be on purpose -- the desired readership could be tween and teen girls . ''",

The P320 will be known as the M17 ( full size ) and M18 ( compact ) in U.S. Military service . Though the pistol will remain chambered in 9 x 19mm Parabellum rather than a larger caliber , the contract allows the Army and other services to procure Sig Sauer 's proposed XM1152 Full Metal Jacket and XM1153 Special Purpose ammunition . The ammunition chosen to go with the pistol is a `` Winchester jacketed hollow point '' round . In May 2017 , the Army announced that the first unit that will receive the M17 would be the 101st Airborne Division by the end of the year . At the same time , the rest of the U.S. Armed Forces revealed they also intend to acquire the handgun , making it the standard sidearm for the entire U.S. military . The services plan to procure up to 421,000 weapons in total ; 195,000 for the Army , 130,000 for the Air Force , 61,000 for the Navy ( XM18 compact version only ) , and 35,000 for the Marines .",

    "question": "who sang the theme song for all in the family",
    "context": "For the show 's final season , the practice of being taped before a live audience changed to playing the already taped and edited show to an audience and recording their laughter to add to the original sound track . Thus , the voice - over during the end credits was changed from Rob Reiner 's `` All in the Family was recorded on tape before a live audience '' to Carroll O'Connor's `` All in the Family was played to a studio audience for live responses '' . ( Typically , the audience was gathered for a taping of One Day at a Time , and got to see All In the Family as a bonus . ) Throughout its run , Norman Lear took pride in the fact that canned laughter was never used ( mentioning this on many occasions ) ; the laughter heard in the episodes was genuine . The series ' opening theme song `` Those Were The Days '' , written by Lee Adams ( lyrics ) and Charles Strouse ( music ) , was presented in a unique way for a 1970s series : Carroll O'Connor and Jean Stapleton seated at a console or spinet piano ( played by Stapleton ) and singing the tune together on - camera at the start of every episode , concluding with live - audience applause . ( The song dates back to the first Justice For All pilot , although on that occasion O'Connor and Stapleton performed the song off - camera and at a faster tempo than the series version . ) Six different performances were recorded over the run of the series , including one version that includes additional lyrics . The song is a simple , pentatonic melody ( that can be played exclusively with black keys on a piano ) in which Archie and Edith wax nostalgic for the simpler days of yesteryear . A longer version of the song was released as a single on Atlantic Records , reaching number 43 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number 30 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart in early 1972 ; the additional lyrics in this longer version lend the song a greater sense of sadness , and make poignant reference to social changes taking place in the 1960s and early 1970s .

    "question": "differentiate between the different steps of scientific inquiry",
    "context": "The method is a continuous process that begins with observations about the natural world . People are naturally inquisitive , so they often come up with questions about things they see or hear , and they often develop ideas or hypotheses about why things are the way they are . The best hypotheses lead to predictions that can be tested in various ways . The strongest tests of hypotheses come from carefully controlled experiments that gather empirical data . Depending on how well additional tests match the predictions , the original hypothesis may require refinement , alteration , expansion or even rejection . If a particular hypothesis becomes very well supported , a general theory may be developed . Although procedures vary from one field of inquiry to another , they are frequently the same from one to another . The process of the scientific method involves making conjectures ( hypotheses ) , deriving predictions from them as logical consequences , and then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions . A hypothesis is a conjecture , based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question . The hypothesis might be very specific , or it might be broad . Scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments or studies . A scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable , implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis ; otherwise , the hypothesis can not be meaningfully tested . The purpose of an experiment is to determine whether observations agree with or conflict with the predictions derived from a hypothesis . Experiments can take place anywhere from a college lab to CERN 's Large Hadron Collider . There are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method , however . Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps , it represents rather a set of general principles . Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry ( nor to the same degree ) , and they are not always in the same order . Some philosophers and scientists have argued that there is no scientific method ; they include physicist Lee Smolin and philosopher Paul Feyerabend ( in his Against Method ) . Nola and Sankey remark that `` For some , the whole idea of a theory of scientific method is yester - year 's debate '' .",

    "context": "`` ( I 've Had ) The Time of My Life '' is a 1987 song composed by Franke Previte , John DeNicola , and Donald Markowitz . It was recorded by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes , and used as the theme song for the 1987 film Dirty Dancing . The song has won a number of awards , including an Academy Award for `` Best Original Song '' , a Golden Globe Award for `` Best Original Song '' , and a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals . Singer - songwriter Previte was the lead singer of the band Franke and the Knockouts . He had success with the song `` Sweetheart '' in 1981 , but by 1986 was without a recording contract . In late 1986 or early 1987 , producer and head of Millennium Records , Jimmy Ienner , asked Previte about writing some music for `` a little movie called Dirty Dancing '' . Previte initially turned the request down because he was still trying to get a record deal , but Ienner was persistent , and got Previte to write several songs for the film , including `` Hungry Eyes '' , later recorded by singer Eric Carmen , which also became a top 10 hit .",

    "question": "where did the cardinals play before busch stadium",
    "context": "Ballpark Village , a mixed - use development located across Clark Street from Busch Stadium , is targeted to enhance the ballpark goers ' experience . Phase 1 of the development , completed for the start of the 2014 season , includes entertainment venues , restaurants , and retail . Anchored by Cardinals Nation ( which includes the Cardinals Hall of Fame , a two - story Cardinals - themed restaurant and all - inclusive rooftop seating for 300 + fans featuring spectacular views of the field across the street ) , a 20,000 sq ft Budweiser Brew House , FOX Sports Midwest Live ! and PBR , the $100 million phase 1 development of Ballpark Village promises to be a vibrant gathering space throughout the year , not just during the baseball season . Busch Stadium is the Cardinals ' fourth home ballpark and the third of that name . The Cardinals ' original home ballpark was Sportsman 's Park from 1882 -- 1892 when they played in the American Association and were known as the Browns . In 1893 , the Browns moved to a new ballpark five blocks northwest of Sportsman 's Park which would serve as their home from 1893 -- 1920 . The new park was originally called New Sportsman 's Park but became more commonly referred to as Robison Field . Midway through the 1920 season the Cardinals abandoned Robison Field and returned to the original Sportsman 's Park and became tenants of their American League rivals , the St. Louis Browns . In 1953 , the Anheuser - Busch Brewery purchased the Cardinals and the new owner subsequently also purchased Sportsman 's Park from the Browns and renamed it Busch Stadium , later becoming Busch I . The Browns then left St. Louis for Baltimore after the season . The Cardinals built Busch Memorial Stadium , or Busch II , in downtown St. Louis , opened it during the 1966 season and played there until 2005 . It was built as the multi-purpose stadium home of both the baseball Cardinals and the football Cardinals , now the Arizona Cardinals . The current Busch Stadium was constructed adjacent to , and partly atop , the site of Busch Memorial Stadium . The Cardinals home field in spring training is Roger Dean Stadium in Jupiter , Florida . They share the complex , which opened in 1998 , with the Miami Marlins . Before moving to Jupiter , the Cardinals hosted spring training at Al Lang Field in St. Petersburg , Florida from 1937 -- 1997 .",

    "question": "how many towns and cities in rhode island",
    "context": "Rhode Island is a state located in the Northeastern United States . According to the 2010 United States Census , Rhode Island is the 8th least populous state with 7006105256700000000 ♠ 1,052,567 inhabitants and the smallest by land area spanning 1,033.81 square miles ( 2,677.6 km ) of land . Rhode Island is divided into 39 incorporated municipalities , including 8 cities and 31 towns , grouped into 5 historic counties which have no municipal functions as the state has no county level of government . The entire area of the state is governed by town administrations except for areas within the boundaries of cities . Municipalities in Rhode Island can incorporate as a town or city by a special act of the state legislature and there is no minimum population requirement . Eight municipalities were re -- incorporated as cities operating under a charter , while the other thirty -- one remain as towns which perform similar services . Since Rhode Island has no county level of government , cities and towns provide services commonly performed by county governments in other states . Rhode Island 's cities and towns may adopt one of four different forms of government : council -- manager , mayor -- council , town council -- town meeting , or administrator -- council . The primary difference between these forms of government is how the chief executive is selected . The Council -- manager system involves an elected council who exercise overall control of the local government and a chief executive termed city or town manager who is generally appointed by and responsible to the council for the administration of local policies . Council -- manager systems may elect a mayor but they have no formal administrative functions with the potential exception of a degree of veto power . Mayor -- council systems have a similarly elected council however the mayor is elected and yields administrative power . In the town council -- town meeting system , there is no full -- time chief executive . There are no towns or cities in Rhode Island that use the administrator -- council form of government .",

    "question": "where was the law written in the old testament",
    "context": "God is consistently depicted as the one who created or put into order the world and guides its history . Although the God of the Old Testament is not consistently presented as the only God who exists , he is always depicted as the only God whom Israel is to worship , or the one `` true God '' , that only the Jehovah of Israel is Almighty , and both Jews and Christians have always interpreted the Bible ( both the `` Old '' and `` New '' Testaments ) as an affirmation of the oneness of Almighty God . The Old Testament stresses the special relationship between God and his chosen people , Israel , but includes instructions for proselytes as well . This relationship is expressed in the biblical covenant ( contract ) between the two , received by Moses . The law codes in books such as Exodus and especially Deuteronomy are the terms of the contract : Israel swears faithfulness to God , and God swears to be Israel 's special protector and supporter . Further themes in the Old Testament include salvation , redemption , divine judgment , obedience and disobedience , faith and faithfulness , among others . Throughout there is a strong emphasis on ethics and ritual purity , both of which God demands , although some of the prophets and wisdom writers seem to question this , arguing that God demands social justice above purity , and perhaps does not even care about purity at all . The Old Testament 's moral code enjoins fairness , intervention on behalf of the vulnerable , and the duty of those in power to administer justice righteously . It forbids murder , bribery and corruption , deceitful trading , and many sexual misdemeanors . All morality is traced back to God , who is the source of all goodness .",

    "question": "which country established colonies in present day canada",
    "context": "The history of Canada covers the period from the arrival of Paleo - Indians thousands of years ago to the present day . Prior to European colonization , the lands encompassing present - day Canada were inhabited for millennia by Indigenous peoples , with distinct trade networks , spiritual beliefs , and styles of social organization . Some of these older civilizations had long faded by the time of the first European arrivals and have been discovered through archaeological investigations . Starting in the late 15th century , French and British expeditions explored , colonized , and fought over various places within North America in what constitutes present - day Canada . The colony of New France was established in 1534 and was ceded to the United Kingdom in 1763 after the French defeat in the Seven Years ' War . The now British Province of Quebec was divided into Upper and Lower Canada in 1791 and reunified in 1841 . In 1867 , the Province of Canada was joined with two other British colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia through Confederation , forming a self - governing entity named Canada . The new dominion expanded by incorporating other parts of British North America , finishing with Newfoundland and Labrador in 1949 . Although responsible government had existed in Canada since 1848 , Britain continued to set its foreign and defence policies until the end of the First World War . The passing of the Statute of Westminster in 1931 recognized that Canada had become co-equal with the United Kingdom . After the Constitution was patriated in 1982 , the final vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament were removed . Canada currently consists of ten provinces and three territories and is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state .",

    "question": "when do we use pivot table in excel",
    "context": "A pivot table is a table that summarizes data from another table , and is made by applying an operation such as sorting , averaging , or summing to data in the first table , typically including grouping of the data . A trivial example is a column of numbers as the first table , and the column average as a pivot table with only one row and column . A slightly less trivial example is a table with columns sex and height , each row giving the sex and height of a person , and a pivot table made from it with the same two columns but only two rows , with `` male '' and `` female '' in the sex column and the average height of each sex in the height column . A third more complex and more typical example adds another dimension to the pivot table : a data table has columns month , salesperson , product and sales , each row giving the total sales of some product by some salesperson in a certain month , and a pivot table made from it has a first column salesperson of salespeople names and the remaining column names are product names and contain the total sales by that salesperson of that product over all months . Pivot tables are used in data processing and are found in data visualization programs such as spreadsheets or business intelligence software . Such programs can automatically sort , count , total or average the data stored in one table or spreadsheet , displaying the results in a second table -- the pivot table -- showing the summarized data . The user often sets up and changes the summary 's structure by dragging and dropping fields graphically . This `` rotation '' or pivoting of the summary table gives the concept its name . Pivot tables are related to contingency tables ( also known as a cross tabulation or crosstab ) , but a pivot table is considered more dynamic , and can have operations performed on it , whereas a contingency table is a static display of data .",

    "question": "why is ancient greece often labeled the start of western civilization",
    "context": "A cornerstone of Western thought , beginning in ancient Greece and continuing through the Middle Ages and Renaissance , is the idea of rationalism in various spheres of life , especially religion , developed by Hellenistic philosophy , Scholasticism , and humanism . The Catholic Church was for centuries at the center of the development of the values , ideas , science , laws , and institutions which constitute Western civilization . Empiricism later gave rise to the scientific method during the Scientific revolution and the Enlightenment . Values of Western culture have , throughout history , been derived from political thought , widespread employment of rational argument favouring freethought , assimilation of human rights , the need for equality and democracy . Ancient Greece is considered the birthplace of many elements of Western culture , with the world 's first democratic system of government and major advances in philosophy , science and mathematics . Greece was followed by Rome , which made key contributions in law , government , engineering and political organization . Western culture continued to develop with the Christianisation of Europe during the Middle Ages and the reform and modernization triggered by the Renaissance . The Church preserved the intellectual developments of classical antiquity , and is the reason many of them are still known today . Medieval Christianity created the university , the hospital system , scientific economics , natural law ( which would later influence the creation of international law ) , and numerous other innovations across all intellectual fields . Christianity played a role in ending practices common among pagan societies , such as human sacrifice , slavery , infanticide and polygamy . The globalization by successive European empires spread European ways of life and European educational methods around the world between the 16th and 20th centuries . European culture developed with a complex range of philosophy , medieval scholasticism and mysticism , and Christian and secular humanism . Rational thinking developed through a long age of change and formation , with the experiments of the Enlightenment , and breakthroughs in the sciences . Tendencies that have come to define modern Western societies include the concept of political pluralism , prominent subcultures or countercultures ( such as New Age movements ) and increasing cultural syncretism resulting from globalization and human migration . The West as a geographical area is unclear and undefined . More often a country 's ideology is what will be used to categorize it as a Western society . There is some disagreement about what nations should or should not be included in the category , and at what times . Many parts of the Eastern Roman Empire are considered Western today but were Eastern in the past . Geographically , the `` West '' of today would include Europe ( especially the European Union countries ) together with extra-European territories belonging to the English - speaking world , as well as the Hispanidad , the Lusosphere or the Francophonie in the wider context . Since the context is highly biased and context - dependent , there is no agreed definition what the `` West '' is .",

    "question": "who designed the typeface that became the standard for british newspapers",
    "context": "Times New Roman is a serif typeface designed for legibility in body text . It was commissioned by the British newspaper The Times in 1931 and conceived by Stanley Morison , the artistic advisor to the British branch of the printing equipment company Monotype , in collaboration with Victor Lardent , a lettering artist in the Times ' advertising department . Although no longer used by The Times , Times New Roman is still very common in book and general printing . It has become one of the most popular and influential typefaces in history and a standard typeface on most desktop computers . Times New Roman 's creation took place through the influence of Stanley Morison of Monotype . Morison was an artistic director at Monotype , historian of printing and informal adviser to The Times . Asked to advise on a redesign , he recommended that they change their text typeface from a spindly and somewhat dated nineteenth - century face to a more robust , solid design , returning to traditions of printing from the eighteenth century and before . This matched a common trend in printing tastes of the period .",

    "context": "Active transport is the movement of molecules across a membrane from a region of their lower concentration to a region of their higher concentration -- in the direction against the concentration gradient . Active transport requires cellular energy to achieve this movement . There are two types of active transport -- primary active transport that uses ATP , and secondary active transport that uses an electrochemical gradient . An example of active transport in human physiology is the uptake of glucose in the intestines . Active transport is the movement of molecules across a membrane from a region of their lower concentration to a region of their higher concentration -- in the direction against the concentration gradient or other obstructing factor ( often a concentration gradient ) .",

    "question": "who were the two opposing sides in the american revolution",
    "context": "The American Revolution was a colonial revolt that took place between 1765 and 1783 . The American Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies won independence from Great Britain , becoming the United States of America . They defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War in alliance with France and others . Members of American colonial society argued the position of `` no taxation without representation '' , starting with the Stamp Act Congress in 1765 . They rejected the authority of the British Parliament to tax them because they lacked representation in Parliament . Protests steadily escalated to the burning of the Gaspee in Rhode Island in 1772 , followed by the Boston Tea Party in 1773 , during which patriots destroyed a consignment of taxed tea . The British responded by closing Boston Harbor , then followed with a series of legislative acts which effectively rescinded Massachusetts Bay Colony 's rights of self - government and caused the other colonies to rally behind Massachusetts . In late 1774 , the Patriots set up their own alternative government to better coordinate their resistance efforts against Great Britain ; other colonists preferred to remain aligned to the British Crown and were known as Loyalists or Tories .",

This will be the 12th Cricket World Cup competition , and the fifth time it will be held in England and Wales , following the 1975 , 1979 , 1983 and 1999 World Cups . The format for the tournament will be a single group of ten teams , with each team playing the other nine teams , and the top four teams progressing to a knockout stage of semi-finals and a final . The hosting rights were awarded in April 2006 , after England and Wales withdrew from the bidding to host the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup , which was held in Australia and New Zealand . The first match will be played at The Oval while the final will be played at Lord 's . The 10 - team - tournament has gained much criticism due to the lack of associate teams in the tournament and given the increase of the test playing nations from 10 to 12 with the admission of Ireland and Afghanistan in June 2017 it will be the first World Cup to be contested without all of the test playing nations being present , but the ICC plan to keep the competition at just 10 teams .

    "context": "`` Who You Are '' is a song by British singer and songwriter Jessie J , released as the sixth overall single from her debut studio album of the same name . The song was written by Jessica Cornish ( Jessie J ) , Toby Gad and Shelly Peiken , while the production was handled by Gad . The single was released via digital download on 13 November 2011 .

Cornish named her first studio album Who You Are after the track of the same name , revealing that she is proudest of that song . She wrote `` Who You Are '' at the end of a lonely three - month trip to Los Angeles when she was 20 , having been shunted from studio to studio with various producers . During an intimate show at The Sofitel 's Stone Rose on 2 November 2010 , the singer explained the meaning of the recording , `` I kind of lost myself . It 's very personal . It 's about being true to yourself . Do n't lose yourself in any situation you 're put in , and do the dew . '' She further explained to The Sun , `` This song saved my life musically . The day before I wrote this song I was ready to give up music . It 's amazing how three - and - a-half minutes of melody and lyrics can change your life and I 'm so happy that not only has it saved my life but it 's saving other people 's . That 's why my debut album is called Who You Are . '' According to The Independent , `` Who You Are '' is the song that draws the most messages from fans on YouTube , Twitter and Facebook .

    "context": "And Isis answer made : Of living things , my son , some are made friends with fire , and some with water , some with air , and some with earth , and some with two or three of these , and some with all . And , on the contrary , again some are made enemies of fire , and some of water , some of earth , and some of air , and some of two of them , and some of three , and some of all . For instance , son , the locust and all flies flee fire ; the eagle and the hawk and all high - flying birds flee water ; fish , air and earth ; the snake avoids the open air . Whereas snakes and all creeping things love earth ; all swimming things love water ; winged things , air , of which they are the citizens ; while those that fly still higher love the fire and have the habitat near it . Not that some of the animals as well do not love fire ; for instance salamanders , for they even have their homes in it . It is because one or another of the elements doth form their bodies ' outer envelope . Each soul , accordingly , while it is in its body is weighted and constricted by these four . According to Galen , these elements were used by Hippocrates in describing the human body with an association with the four humours : yellow bile ( fire ) , black bile ( earth ) , blood ( air ) , and phlegm ( water ) . Medical care was flexible and primarily about helping the patient stay in or return to his / her own personal natural balanced state . In Babylonian mythology , the cosmogony called Enûma Eliš , a text written between the 18th and 16th centuries BC , involves four gods that we might see as personified cosmic elements : sea , earth , sky , wind . In other Babylonian texts these phenomena are considered independent of their association with deities , though they are not treated as the component elements of the universe , as later in Empedocles .",

    "context": "Beer head ( also head or collar ) , is the frothy foam on top of beer which is produced by bubbles of gas , typically carbon dioxide , rising to the surface . The elements that produce the head are wort protein , yeast and hop residue . The carbon dioxide that forms the bubbles in the head is produced during fermentation . The carbonation can occur before or after bottling the beer . If the beer continues fermenting in the bottle , then it naturally carbonates and the head is formed upon opening and / or pouring the beer . If the beer is pasteurized or filtered then the beer must be force carbonated using pressurized gas . The density and longevity of the head will be determined by the type of malt and adjunct from which the beer was fermented . Different mash schedules and cereal sources influence head retention . In general , wheat tends to produce larger and longer - lasting heads than barley .",

    "context": "The election of President and Vice President of the United States is an indirect election in which citizens of the United States who are registered to vote in one of the 50 U.S. states or Washington , D.C. cast ballots for members of the U.S. Electoral College , known as electors . These electors then in turn cast direct votes , known as electoral votes , for President and Vice President . The candidate who receives an absolute majority of electoral votes for President or Vice President ( currently , at least 270 out of a total of 538 ) is then elected to that office . If no candidate receives an absolute majority for President , the House of Representatives chooses the President ; if no one receives a majority for Vice President , then the Senate chooses the Vice President . The Electoral College and its procedure is established in the U.S. Constitution by Article II , Section 1 , Clauses 2 and 4 ; and the Twelfth Amendment ( which replaced Clause 3 after its ratification in 1804 ) . Under Clause 2 , each of the states casts as many electoral votes as the total number of its Senators and Representatives in Congress , while , per the Twenty - third Amendment ratified in 1961 , Washington , D.C. casts the same number of electoral votes as the least - represented state , which is three . Also under Clause 2 , the manner for choosing electors is determined by each state legislature , not directly by the federal government . Many state legislatures previously selected their electors directly , but over time all of them switched to using the popular vote to help determine electors , which persists today . Once chosen , electors generally cast their electoral votes for the candidate who won the plurality in their state , but at least 21 states do not have provisions that specifically address this behavior ; those who vote in opposition to the plurality are known as `` faithless '' or `` unpledged electors '' . In modern times , faithless and unpledged electors have not affected the ultimate outcome of an election , so the results can generally be determined based on the state - by - state popular vote .",

    "context": "The median strip or central reservation is the reserved area that separates opposing lanes of traffic on divided roadways , such as divided highways , dual carriageways , freeways , and motorways . The term also applies to divided roadways other than highways , such as some major streets in urban or suburban areas . The reserved area may simply be paved , but commonly it is adapted to other functions ; for example , it may accommodate decorative landscaping , trees , a median barrier or railway , light rail or streetcar lines . There is no international English standard for the term . Median , median strip , and median divider island are common in North American and Antipodean English .

    "context": "Piano pedals are foot - operated levers at the base of a piano which change the instrument 's sound in various ways . Modern pianos usually have three pedals , from left to right , the soft pedal ( or una corda ) , the sostenuto pedal , and the sustaining pedal ( or damper pedal ) . Some pianos omit the sostenuto pedal , or have a middle pedal with a different purpose such as a muting function also known as silent piano . The development of the piano 's pedals is an evolution that began from the very earliest days of the piano , and continued through the late 19th century . Throughout the years , the piano had as few as one modifying stop , and as many as six or more , before finally arriving at its current configuration of three .",

    "question": "what short-term political change resulted from the french revolution",
    "context": "The French Revolution had a major impact on Europe and the New World . Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history . In the short - term , France lost thousands of her countrymen in the form of émigrés , or emigrants who wished to escape political tensions and save their lives . A number of individuals settled in the neighboring countries ( chiefly Great Britain , Germany , Austria , and Prussia ) , however quite a few also went to the United States . The displacement of these Frenchmen led to a spread of French culture , policies regulating immigration , and a safe haven for Royalists and other counterrevolutionaries to outlast the violence of the French Revolution . The long - term impact on France was profound , shaping politics , society , religion and ideas , and polarizing politics for more than a century . The closer other countries were , the greater and deeper was the French impact , bringing liberalism and the end of many feudal or traditional laws and practices . However , there was also a conservative counter-reaction that defeated Napoleon , reinstalled the Bourbon kings , and in some ways reversed the new reforms . Most of the new nations created by the French were abolished and returned to prewar owners in 1814 . However , Frederick Artz emphasizes the benefits the Italians gained from the French Revolution :",

    "question": "where was o brother where art thou filmed",
    "context": "The Coens used digital color correction to give the film a sepia - tinted look . Joel stated this was because the actual set was `` greener than Ireland . '' Cinematographer Roger Deakins stated , `` Ethan and Joel favored a dry , dusty Delta look with golden sunsets . They wanted it to look like an old hand - tinted picture , with the intensity of colors dictated by the scene and natural skin tones that were all shades of the rainbow . '' Initially the crew tried to perform the color correction using a physical process , however after several tries with various chemical processes proved unsatisfactory , it became necessary to perform the process digitally . This was the fifth film collaboration between the Coen Brothers and Deakins , and it was slated to be shot in Mississippi at a time of year when the foliage , grass , trees , and bushes would be a lush green . It was filmed near locations in Canton , Mississippi and Florence , South Carolina in the summer of 1999 . After shooting tests , including film bipack and bleach bypass techniques , Deakins suggested digital mastering be used . Deakins subsequently spent 11 weeks fine - tuning the look , mainly targeting the greens , making them a burnt yellow and desaturating the overall image in the digital files . This made it the first feature film to be entirely color corrected by digital means , narrowly beating Nick Park 's Chicken Run . O Brother , Where Art Thou ? was the first time a digital intermediate was used on the entirety of a first - run Hollywood film that otherwise had very few visual effects . The work was done in Los Angeles by Cinesite using a Spirit DataCine for scanning at 2K resolution , a Pandora MegaDef to adjust the color , and a Kodak Lightning II recorder to put out to film .",

    "question": "what are the two factors that affect atomic radius",
    "context": "The atomic radius of a chemical element is a measure of the size of its atoms , usually the mean or typical distance from the center of the nucleus to the boundary of the surrounding cloud of electrons . Since the boundary is not a well - defined physical entity , there are various non-equivalent definitions of atomic radius . Three widely used definitions of atomic radius are : Van der Waals radius , ionic radius , and covalent radius . Depending on the definition , the term may apply only to isolated atoms , or also to atoms in condensed matter , covalently bound in molecules , or in ionized and excited states ; and its value may be obtained through experimental measurements , or computed from theoretical models . The value of the radius may depend on the atom 's state and context . Electrons do not have definite orbits , or sharply defined ranges . Rather , their positions must be described as probability distributions that taper off gradually as one moves away from the nucleus , without a sharp cutoff . Moreover , in condensed matter and molecules , the electron clouds of the atoms usually overlap to some extent , and some of the electrons may roam over a large region encompassing two or more atoms .",

    "context": "Several months pass with Carlisle monitoring Renesmee 's rapid growth . On an outing in the woods , a bitter Irina sees Renesmee from a distance and believes her to be an immortal child . Immortal children were vampires who were changed in childhood , and because they could not be trained nor restrained , they destroyed entire villages . They were eventually executed , as were the parents who created them , and the creation of such children outlawed . Irina goes to the Volturi to report what she has seen . Alice sees the Volturi and Irina coming to kill the Cullens , and instructs the others to gather as many witnesses as they can to testify that Renesmee is not an immortal . The Cullens begin to summon witnesses , such as the Denali family . One of the Denali , Eleazar , later discovers that Bella has a special ability : a powerful mental shield which had protected her from Edward 's mind reading even when she was human , and which she can now extend to protect others from attacks . As some of their potential witnesses are attacked and prevented from supporting the Cullens , Carlisle and Edward realize they may have to fight the Volturi . Their witnesses ultimately agree to stand with them in battle , having realized the Volturi increased the Guard by falsely accusing covens of crimes , destroy them and then recruit vampires with gifts . The Volturi arrive prepared for battle , led by Aro , who is eager to obtain the gifted members of the Cullen coven as part of his guard . Aro is allowed to touch Renesmee , and is convinced that she is not an immortal child . Irina is brought forth and takes full responsibility for her mistake , leading to her immediate death . Aro still insists that Renesmee may pose a risk in the future , validating his claim that battle is necessary . Before any violence , Alice shares with Aro her vision of the battle that is to come , during which both sides sustain heavy casualties , including Aro who would also die . Aro believes her , giving Alice and Jasper an opportunity to reveal their witness , Nahuel ( a half - mortal half - vampire just like Renesmee ) . The witness proves that he is not a threat , supporting the notion that Renesmee is not a threat . The Volturi unhappily walk away , explaining that there will be no battle today . Back at the Cullen home , Alice glimpses the future , seeing Edward and Bella together with Jacob and a fully matured Renesmee also together . Edward reads Alice 's mind and feels relieved that Renesmee has Jacob to protect her . Alone in the meadow , Bella pushes her mental shield away and finally allows Edward a peek into her mind , showing him every precious moment she and Edward shared together and the two share a kiss after Bella telling Edward , `` Nobody has ever loved anybody as much as I love you '' , and both Edward and Bella saying they 'll love and be together forever .

    "context": "Sony Pictures was dubious over Stone 's choice of Crowe because he was not a famous actor in the mid-1990s . To cast Gene Hackman in the role of Herod , TriStar Pictures changed the shooting location from Durango , Mexico to Tucson , Arizona . Sam Rockwell auditioned for The Kid , a role which ended up going to Leonardo DiCaprio . Sony was also dubious over DiCaprio 's casting . As a result , Stone decided to pay for the actor 's salary herself . Filming was originally set to begin in October 1993 , but was delayed because Crowe was busy on another film in Australia . Principal photography for The Quick and the Dead lasted from November 21 , 1993 to February 27 , 1994 . Locations included Old Tucson Studios in Arizona and Mescal , 40 miles southeast of Tucson . Production was briefly halted at times over weather problems . Thell Reed , who was hired as the gun coach and weapons master , worked with the cast through over three months of training . To age Cort 's Colt 1851 Navy Revolver and the other guns used , Reed experimented with simple measures . `` I took them out by my swimming pool and dipped them in chlorine water to let them rust , '' he explained . `` They looked rusty and old , but were brand new guns . '' Such detail , including the nickel plating and ivory handles on Ellen 's Colt Peacemakers , was accurate to the time period . The town of Redemption was designed by Patrizia von Brandenstein , known for her work on Amadeus ( 1984 ) and The Untouchables ( 1987 ) . Raimi 's first choice as the visual effects supervisor was William Mesa , his collaborator on Darkman ( 1991 ) and Army of Darkness ( 1993 ) . Instead , Sony chose The Computer Film Company to create the VFX sequences . Pick - up scenes took place through November - December 1994 .

    "context": "The Space Race refers to the 20th - century competition between two Cold War rivals , the Soviet Union ( USSR ) and the United States ( US ) , for dominance in spaceflight capability . It had its origins in the missile - based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following World War II , aided by captured German missile technology and personnel from the Aggregat program . The technological superiority required for such dominance was seen as necessary for national security , and symbolic of ideological superiority . The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites , uncrewed space probes of the Moon , Venus , and Mars , and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon . The Space Race began on August 2 , 1955 , when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year , by declaring they would also launch a satellite `` in the near future '' . The Soviet Union beat the US to this , with the October 4 , 1957 , orbiting of Sputnik 1 , and later beat the US to the first human in space , Yuri Gagarin , on April 12 , 1961 . The `` race '' peaked with the July 20 , 1969 , US landing of the first humans on the Moon with Apollo 11 .

    "context": "The Founding Fathers of the United States were those individuals of the Thirteen Colonies in North America who led the American Revolution against the authority of the British Crown in word and deed and contributed to the establishment of the United States of America . Historian Richard B. Morris in 1973 identified the following seven figures as the key Founding Fathers : John Adams , Benjamin Franklin , Alexander Hamilton , John Jay , Thomas Jefferson , James Madison , and George Washington . Adams , Jefferson , and Franklin were members of the Committee of Five that drafted the Declaration of Independence . Hamilton , Madison , and Jay were authors of The Federalist Papers , advocating ratification of the Constitution . The constitutions drafted by Jay and Adams for their respective states of New York ( 1777 ) and Massachusetts ( 1780 ) were heavily relied upon when creating language for the US Constitution Jay , Adams and Franklin negotiated the Treaty of Paris ( 1783 ) that would end the American Revolutionary War . Washington was Commander - in - Chief of the Continental Army and was President of the Constitutional Convention . Washington , Jay and Franklin are considered the Founding Fathers of U.S. Intelligence by the CIA . All held additional important roles in the early government of the United States , with Washington , Adams , Jefferson , and Madison serving as President . Jay was the nation 's first Chief Justice . Four of these seven - Washington , Jay , Hamilton and Madison - were not signers of the Declaration of Independence . The term Founding Fathers is sometimes used to refer to the Signers of the embossed version of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 . It is not to be confused with the term Framers ; the Framers are defined by the National Archives as those 55 individuals who were appointed to be delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention and took part in drafting the proposed Constitution of the United States . Of the 55 Framers , only 39 were signers of the Constitution . Two further groupings of Founding Fathers include : 1 ) those who signed the Continental Association , a trade ban and one of the colonists ' first collective volleys protesting British control and the Intolerable Acts in 1774 or 2 ) those who signed the Articles of Confederation , the first U.S. constitutional document .",

    "question": "what types of pitches does cc sabathia throw",
    "context": "Despite throwing with his left hand as well as batting from the left , Sabathia is right - handed . Sabathia has six pitches : a cutter ( 89 -- 92 MPH ) , a more used two - seam / sinker fastball ( 88 -- 93 MPH ) , a Four seam fastball ( 89 - 94 mph ) , a curve ball ( 74 - 76 MPH ) , a slider ( 78 -- 82 MPH ) , and changeup ( 82 -- 84 MPH ) . Once ahead in the count , he primarily uses his changeup to strike out right - handed batters , and his slider to strike out left - handers . He also exhibits good command of his pitches , posting a 5.65 K / BB ratio in 2007 . Throughout most of his career , Sabathia 's four - seam fastball sat in the 92 - 96 mph range ( topping out at 98 mph ) and his sinking fastball averaged 89 - 93 mph ( topping out at 96 mph ) , thus making him a power pitcher . Since 2013 , Sabathia has become accustomed to being a control pitcher , in the 2017 he cut down his usage of the four - seamer ( 87 - 91 mph topping out at 93 mph ) and favored the sinker and cutter . Sabathia holds a lifetime postseason record of 10 wins and 5 losses in 22 games ( 21 starts ) . He has pitched a total of 123 postseason innings , giving up 127 hits , 58 walks and 58 earned runs resulting in a 4.24 ERA . He also struck out 120 batters .",

    "question": "where is black soil found in the world",
    "context": "The name comes from the Russian terms for black and soil , earth or land ( chyorn + zemlya ) . The soil , rich in organic matter presenting a black color , was first identified by Russian geologist Vasily Dokuchaev in 1883 in the tallgrass steppe or prairie of European Russia . Chernozems cover about 230 million hectares of land . There are two `` chernozem belts '' in the world : the Eurasian steppe which extends from eastern Croatia ( Slavonia ) , along the Danube ( northern Serbia , northern Bulgaria ( Danubian Plain ) , southern Romania ( Wallachian Plain ) and Moldova ) to northeast Ukraine across the Central Black Earth Region of southern Russia into Siberia , and the other from the Canadian Prairies in Manitoba through the Great Plains of the United States as far south as Kansas . Similar soil types occur in Texas and Hungary . Chernozem layer thickness may vary widely , from several centimetres up to 1.5 metres ( 60 inches ) in Ukraine , as well as the Red River Valley region in the Northern United States and Canada ( an area formerly known as lake Agassiz ) . The terrain can also be found in small quantities elsewhere ( for example , on 1 % of Poland ) . It also exists in Northeast China , near Harbin . The only true Chernozem in Australia is located around Nimmitabel producing some of the richest soils in the nation .",

    "context": "Upland and lowland are portions of plain that are conditionally categorized by their elevation above the sea level . Lowlands are usually no higher than 200 m ( 660 ft ) , while uplands are somewhere around 200 m ( 660 ft ) to 500 m ( 1,600 ft ) . On rare occasions , certain lowlands such as Caspian Depression lay below the sea level . Upland habitats are cold , clear , rocky , fast - flowing rivers in mountainous areas ; lowland habitats are warm , slow - flowing rivers found in relatively flat lowland areas , with water that is frequently coloured by sediment and organic matter . These classifications overlap with the geological definitions of `` upland '' and `` lowland '' . In geology an `` upland '' is generally considered to be land that is at a higher elevation than the alluvial plain or stream terrace , which are considered to be `` lowlands '' . The term `` bottomland '' refers to low - lying alluvial land near a river .",

    "context": "The Federal Reserve System ( also known as the Federal Reserve or simply the Fed ) is the central banking system of the United States of America . It was created on December 23 , 1913 , with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act , after a series of financial panics ( particularly the panic of 1907 ) led to the desire for central control of the monetary system in order to alleviate financial crises . Over the years , events such as the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Great Recession during the 2000s have led to the expansion of the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System . The U.S. Congress established three key objectives for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act : maximizing employment , stabilizing prices , and moderating long - term interest rates . The first two objectives are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserve 's dual mandate . Its duties have expanded over the years , and currently also include supervising and regulating banks , maintaining the stability of the financial system , and providing financial services to depository institutions , the U.S. government , and foreign official institutions . The Fed conducts research into the economy and provides numerous publications , such as the Beige Book and the FRED database .",

    "context": "`` Take It to the Limit '' is a song by the Eagles from their fourth album One of These Nights from which it was issued as the third single on November 15 , 1975 . It reached No. 4 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and was also the Eagles ' greatest success to that point in the UK , going to No. 12 on the charts . Billboard ranked it as the No. 25 song for 1976 . The song was written by Eagles ' members Randy Meisner , Don Henley and Glenn Frey . Meisner , who sang lead on it , says the song began as his solo composition . As it remained unfinished when time came for the One of These Nights album to be recorded , Henley and Frey assisted Meisner in completing it . Meisner 's performance of the song was popular with the audience in Eagles ' concerts , but disputes over his reluctance to perform it would also directly lead to Meisner 's departure from the band . According to Meisner , he wrote the first few lines of the song one night while playing an acoustic guitar after returning from the Troubadour ; however he was not able to finish the song by the time they were close to recording it , and Frey and Henley then helped him with the lyrics . Meisner later said of how he would usually write songs with the Eagles : `` I 'd get a verse or two , and I 'm done , and they would help fill in the blanks ''",

    "question": "different types of materials used by the florist for making bouquets",
    "context": "Floristry can involve the cultivation of flowers as well as their arrangement , and to the business of selling them . Much of the raw material supplied for the floristry trade comes from the cut flowers industry . Florist shops , along with online stores , are the main flower - only outlets , but supermarkets , garden supply stores , and filling stations also sell flowers . Floral design or floral arts is the art of creating flower arrangements in vases , bowls , baskets , or other containers , or making bouquets and compositions from cut flowers , foliages , herbs , ornamental grasses , and other plant materials . Often the terms `` floral design '' and `` floristry '' are considered synonymous . Florists are people who work with flowers and plants , generally at the retail level . Floristry differs from floristics , the study of distribution and relationships of plant species over geographic areas . Floristry also differs from horticulture , which more broadly relates to the cultivation of flowers and plants so they will remain fresh as long as possible , and would be desirable for purchase , which also involves knowledge of customers ' requirements and expectations . The ability to create a variety of floral designs such as wreaths , bouquets , corsages , boutonnières / ' buttonholes ' , permanent arrangements , and other more complicated arrangements are also important . Education , both formal and informal , is another significant segment of the floristry industry . Established floristry designers and artists impart their craft to students interested in floral design as hobby or career . Courses are generally available through community colleges , private post-secondary vocational schools , and professional florist trade associations .",

    "question": "what were the demands of the populist platform of 1892",
    "context": "The Populist , or People 's , Party went on to capture 11 seats in the United States House of Representatives , several governors and the state legislatures of Kansas , Nebraska and North Carolina . 1892 Presidential nominee and former Greenbacker James B. Weaver received over a million popular votes , and won four states ( Colorado , Kansas , Idaho , and Nevada ) and 22 electoral votes . The Party 's legislative majorities were thereafter able to elect several United States Senators . Taken as a whole , the electoral accomplishments of the Populist Party represent the high water mark for a United States third party after the Civil War . In 1896 , the Populists abandoned the Omaha Platform and endorsed Democratic nominee William Jennings Bryan on the basis of a single - plank free silver platform . The first goal of the Omaha Platform was to increase the coinage of silver to gold at a 16 : 1 ratio . The Omaha Platform suggested a federal loans system so that farmers could get the money they needed . The platform also called for the elimination of private banks . The platform required a system of federal storage facilities for the farmers ' crops . The objective was to allow the farmers to control the pricing of their products . The Omaha Platform made a special taxing system for them so that they would have to pay taxes depending on how much money they made . They also asked for an eight - hour workday and the direct election of senators , as opposed to them being elected by state legislatures . Those were the main goals of the Omaha Platform , all focused on helping rural and working - class Americans . They also made it so that farmers would only work 8 hours instead of 10 or more . After 1894 , Populists emphasized the demand for free coinage of silver rather than other goals , such as state - run railroads . The platform did not appeal to the more urban areas of the country where wage earners were working industrial jobs . The platform 's only clear attempt to appeal to northerners in the east was the clause mentioning pensions to ex-Union soldiers . The Populist Party dissolved before World War II as members were unable to meet in Omaha for the party 's semi-centennial celebration , and for the reason that many of the party 's values have been accepted by other , more dominant political parties .",

    "context": "`` Listen '' is a song recorded by American singer Beyoncé . The song was written by Beyoncé , Henry Krieger , Scott Cutler , and Anne Preven , and produced by The Underdogs , Matt Sullivan and Randy Spendlove for the 2006 musical film Dreamgirls , in which Beyoncé 's character Deena Jones sings the song in an expression of independence from her controlling husband . Columbia Records released `` Listen '' as the lead single from the Dreamgirls : Music from the Motion Picture soundtrack album on December 5 , 2006 . It additionally appeared as a hidden track on international editions , and on the deluxe edition of Beyoncé 's second solo studio album , B'Day . The Spanish version of the song , `` Oye '' , was released on the EP , Irreemplazable , and the Spanish deluxe edition of B'Day . One of four new songs written for the feature version of Dreamgirls ( originally a 1981 Broadway musical ) , `` Listen '' is a soul - R&B song ; its lyrics make reference to tenacity , love , the refusal to defer dreams and finally rise towards fame . Its instrumentation includes bass , drums , guitars , keyboards , percussion , and violins , among others . Contemporary music critics complimented the strong and emotional vocals of Beyoncé , and added that the lyrics perfectly elaborate on Deena Jones 's life . `` Listen '' won Best Original Song at the 2007 Critics ' Choice Awards . It was nominated in the same category at the 2006 International Press Academy Satellite Award , at the 2007 Golden Globe Awards for all songwriters , and at the 2007 Academy Awards , for songwriters Krieger , Cutler , Preven . `` Listen '' peaked at number 61 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and generally peaked inside the top 20 positions in European countries .

    "question": "what was the great pyramid of giza made out of",
    "context": "The completed design dimensions , as suggested by Petrie 's survey and subsequent studies , are estimated to have originally been 280 Egyptian Royal cubits high by 440 cubits long at each of the four sides of its base . The ratio of the perimeter to height of 1760 / 280 Egyptian Royal cubits equates to 2 π to an accuracy of better than 0.05 % ( corresponding to the well - known approximation of π as 22 / 7 ) . Some Egyptologists consider this to have been the result of deliberate design proportion . Verner wrote , `` We can conclude that although the ancient Egyptians could not precisely define the value of π , in practice they used it '' . Petrie , author of Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh concluded : `` but these relations of areas and of circular ratio are so systematic that we should grant that they were in the builder 's design '' . Others have argued that the Ancient Egyptians had no concept of pi and would not have thought to encode it in their monuments . They believe that the observed pyramid slope may be based on a simple seked slope choice alone , with no regard to the overall size and proportions of the finished building . In 2013 , rolls of papyrus called the Diary of Merer were discovered written by some of those who delivered limestone and other construction materials from Tora to Giza . The Great Pyramid consists of an estimated 2.3 million blocks which most believe to have been transported from nearby quarries . The Tura limestone used for the casing was quarried across the river . The largest granite stones in the pyramid , found in the `` King 's '' chamber , weigh 25 to 80 tonnes and were transported from Aswan , more than 800 km ( 500 mi ) away . Traditionally , ancient Egyptians cut stone blocks by hammering into them wooden wedges , which were then soaked with water . As the water was absorbed , the wedges expanded , causing the rock to crack . Once they were cut , they were carried by boat either up or down the Nile River to the pyramid . It is estimated that 5.5 million tonnes of limestone , 8,000 tonnes of granite ( imported from Aswan ) , and 500,000 tonnes of mortar were used in the construction of the Great Pyramid . At completion , the Great Pyramid was surfaced by white `` casing stones '' -- slant - faced , but flat - topped , blocks of highly polished white limestone . These were carefully cut to what is approximately a face slope with a seked of 51⁄2 palms to give the required dimensions . Visibly , all that remains is the underlying stepped core structure seen today . In AD 1303 , a massive earthquake loosened many of the outer casing stones , which were then carted away by Bahri Sultan An - Nasir Nasir - ad - Din al - Hasan in 1356 to build mosques and fortresses in nearby Cairo . Many more casing stones were removed from the great pyramids by Muhammad Ali Pasha in the early 19th century to build the upper portion of his Alabaster Mosque in Cairo , not far from Giza . These limestone casings can still be seen as parts of these structures . Later explorers reported massive piles of rubble at the base of the pyramids left over from the continuing collapse of the casing stones , which were subsequently cleared away during continuing excavations of the site .",

    "context": "The working titles for the show were Teenage Wasteland ( named after the lyric from The Who 's `` Baba O'Riley '' ) , The Kids Are Alright ( named after The Who 's song of the same name ) , Feelin ' All Right , and Reeling in the Years ( named after Steely Dan 's song of the same name ) . However , due to the denials of these three songs from the 1970s ( including Pete Townshend 's denial of using his two songs for each of the two titles ) , and Fox Network 's decision that Feelin ' All Right was not too memorable , co-creator Bonnie Turner suggested that the show should be titled That ' 70s Show , which became the official title . The show usually opens with the theme song , `` In the Street '' , written by Alex Chilton and Chris Bell of the band Big Star . The original version of the song appeared on Big Star 's 1972 debut album # 1 Record . In 2000 , Chilton confirmed that he was paid $70 in royalties each time the show aired , an amount he thought ironic , given the show 's title . Big Star 's original version of the song was not used on the show . Instead , a cover version sung by Todd Griffin was used as the theme song for the show 's first season . Beginning in the second season , the theme song was performed by the band Cheap Trick . Unlike previous versions of the song , Cheap Trick ended the song with the repeated phrase `` We 're all alright ! '' quoting the ending of their 1978 hit song `` Surrender '' .",

    "context": "Kidder was cast in the role of Kathy Lutz after her breakthrough performance as Lois Lane in Superman the year prior . The on - location scenes of The Amityville Horror were filmed at a private residence in Toms River , New Jersey , which had been converted to look like the 112 Ocean Avenue home after authorities in Amityville denied permission for filming on the actual location . Exterior scenes were also filmed in Toms River and Point Pleasant Beach . Local police and ambulance workers would play extras in the film , while the Toms River Volunteer Fire Company was used to provide the rain during several scenes . Indoor shots were filmed at the MGM studio lot in Los Angeles , California . The film shoot was widely publicized in national media when the studio attempted to concoct stories of `` unusual '' occurrences on the set ( not dissimilar from what was claimed to have occurred during the filming of The Exorcist ) . According to Brolin , he and Kidder were both asked by the studio and the press , `` ' Is there weird stuff going on ? ' ... and we were looking for stuff now . We 'd have liked to tell them , ' Oh yeah , you would n't believe the stuff that happened yesterday -- my lunch fell off the table in my lap . ' ''",

    "question": "who is noted for advocating separation of church and state",
    "context": "The incorporation of the First Amendment establishment clause in the landmark case of Everson v. Board of Education has affected the subsequent interpretation of the separation of church and state in regard to the state governments . Although upholding the state law in that case , which provided for public busing to private religious schools , the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment establishment clause was fully applicable to the state governments . A more recent case involving the application of this principle against the states was Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet ( 1994 ) . Jefferson 's concept of `` separation of church and state '' first became a part of Establishment Clause jurisprudence in Reynolds v. U.S. , 98 U.S. 145 ( 1878 ) . In that case , the court examined the history of religious liberty in the US , determining that while the constitution guarantees religious freedom , `` The word ' religion ' is not defined in the Constitution . We must go elsewhere , therefore , to ascertain its meaning , and nowhere more appropriately , we think , than to the history of the times in the midst of which the provision was adopted . '' The court found that the leaders in advocating and formulating the constitutional guarantee of religious liberty were James Madison and Thomas Jefferson . Quoting the `` separation '' paragraph from Jefferson 's letter to the Danbury Baptists , the court concluded that , `` coming as this does from an acknowledged leader of the advocates of the measure , it may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the amendment thus secured . '' The centrality of the `` separation '' concept to the Religion Clauses of the Constitution was made explicit in Everson v. Board of Education , 330 U.S. 1 ( 1947 ) , a case dealing with a New Jersey law that allowed government funds to pay for transportation of students to both public and Catholic schools . This was the first case in which the court applied the Establishment Clause to the laws of a state , having interpreted the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as applying the Bill of Rights to the states as well as the federal legislature . Citing Jefferson , the court concluded that `` The First Amendment has erected a wall between church and state . That wall must be kept high and impregnable . We could not approve the slightest breach . ''",

    "context": "The Ten Commandments ( Hebrew : עֲשֶׂרֶת הַדִּבְּרוֹת ‬ , Aseret ha'Dibrot ) , also known as the Decalogue , are a set of biblical principles relating to ethics and worship , which play a fundamental role in Judaism and Christianity . The commandments include instructions to worship only God , to honour one 's parents , and to keep the sabbath , as well as prohibitions against idolatry , blasphemy , murder , adultery , theft , dishonesty , and coveting . Different religious groups follow different traditions for interpreting and numbering them . The Ten Commandments appear twice in the Hebrew Bible , in the books of Exodus and Deuteronomy . Modern scholarship has found likely influences in Hittite and Mesopotamian laws and treaties , but is divided over exactly when the Ten Commandments were written and who wrote them . In biblical Hebrew , the Ten Commandments are called עשרת הדברים ‬ ( transliterated aseret ha - d'varîm ) and in Rabbinical Hebrew עשרת הדברות ‬ ( transliterated aseret ha - dibrot ) , both translatable as `` the ten words '' , `` the ten sayings '' , or `` the ten matters '' . The Tyndale and Coverdale English translations used `` ten verses '' . The Geneva Bible used `` tenne commandements '' , which was followed by the Bishops ' Bible and the Authorized Version ( the `` King James '' version ) as `` ten commandments '' . Most major English versions use `` commandments . ''",

Likewise , the causes and attributes of the crises changed throughout the decades , including the forms of slavery , brigandage , wars internal and external , land reform , the invention of excruciating new punishments , the expansion of Roman citizenship , and even the changing composition of the Roman army . Modern scholars also disagree about the nature of the crisis . Traditionally , the expansion of citizenship ( with all its rights , privileges , and duties ) was looked upon negatively by Sallust , Gibbon , and others of their schools , because it caused internal dissension , disputes with Rome 's Italian allies , slave revolts , and riots . However , other scholars have argued that as the Republic was meant to be res publica -- the essential thing of the people -- the poor and disenfranchised can not be blamed for trying to redress their legitimate and legal grievances .",

    "question": "where is most cotton grown in the united states",
    "context": "Cotton production is an important economic factor in the United States as the country leads , worldwide , in cotton exportation . The United States is ranked third in production , behind China and India . Almost all of the cotton fiber growth and production occurs in southern and western states , dominated by Texas , California , Arizona , Mississippi , Arkansas , and Louisiana . More than 99 percent of the cotton grown in the US is of the Upland variety , with the rest being American Pima . Cotton production is a $25 billion - per - year industry in the United States , employing over 200,000 people in total , as against growth of forty billion pounds a year from 77 million acres of land covering more than eighty countries . The final estimate of U.S. cotton production in 2012 was 17.31 million bales , with the corresponding figures for China and India being 35 million and 26.5 million bales , respectively . Early cotton farming in the United States is synonymous with the history of slavery in the United States . By the late 1920s around two - thirds of all African - American tenants and almost three - fourths of the croppers worked on cotton farms , and two in three black women from black landowning families were involved in cotton farming . Cotton farming was one of the major areas of racial tension in its history , where many whites expressed concerns about the mass employment of blacks in the industry and the dramatic growth of black landowners . Southern black cotton farmers faced discrimination from the north in particular , and strikes often broke out by black cotton farmers . Although the industry was badly affected by falling prices and pests in the early 1920s , the main reason is undoubtedly the mechanization of agriculture in explaining why many blacks moved to northern American cities in the 1940s and 1950s during the `` Great Migration '' as mechanization of agriculture was introduced , leaving many unemployed . The Hopson Planting Company produced the first crop of cotton to be entirely planted , harvested , and baled by machinery in 1944 .",

In the second act of the musical , Nettie Fowler , the cousin of the protagonist Julie Jordan , sings `` You 'll Never Walk Alone '' to comfort and encourage Julie when her husband , Billy Bigelow , the male lead , falls on his knife and dies after a failed robbery attempt . It is reprised in the final scene to encourage a graduation class of which Louise ( Billy and Julie 's daughter ) is a member . The now invisible Billy , who has been granted the chance to return to Earth for one day in order to redeem himself , watches the ceremony and is able to silently motivate the unhappy Louise to join in the song . The song is also sung at association football clubs around the world , where it is performed by a massed chorus of supporters on matchday ; this tradition began at Liverpool F.C. after the chart success of the 1963 single of the song by the local Liverpool group Gerry and the Pacemakers . Christine Johnson , who created the role of Nettie Fowler , introduced the song in the original Broadway production .

    "context": "The Columbine High School massacre was a school shooting that occurred on April 20 , 1999 , at Columbine High School in Columbine , an unincorporated area of Jefferson County in the American state of Colorado . In addition to the shootings , the complex and highly planned attack involved a fire bomb to divert firefighters , propane tanks converted to bombs placed in the cafeteria , 99 explosive devices , and carbombs . The perpetrators , senior students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold , murdered 12 students and one teacher . They injured 21 additional people , and three more were injured while attempting to escape the school . The pair subsequently committed suicide . Although their precise motives remain unclear , the personal journals of the perpetrators document that they wished their actions to rival the Oklahoma City bombing and other deadly incidents in the United States in the 1990s . The attack has been referred to by USA Today as a `` suicidal attack ( that was ) planned as a grand -- if badly implemented -- terrorist bombing . '' The massacre has been reported as `` the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history . ''",

    "context": "`` Lust for Life '' is a song by American singer Lana Del Rey featuring Canadian singer The Weeknd . It was released on April 19 , 2017 , through Polydor Records and Interscope Records , as the second single from her fifth studio album of the same name ( 2017 ) . The song was written and produced by Del Rey and Rick Nowels , with additional writing from The Weeknd and Max Martin and additional production from Dean Reid and Kieron Menzies . It is her first released song to feature another artist . In an interview with Courtney Love for Dazed magazine , Del Rey revealed that `` Lust for Life '' was the first song she wrote for the album and got an assist from Max Martin for it . She traveled to his Sweden compound where he encouraged her to turn what had previously been a verse into the song 's chorus . Upon returning to her main producer Rick Nowels ' place , she realized the one extra element she needed for the track . That 's when she felt she `` really wanted '' to hear Canadian singer The Weeknd sing the chorus , so he came down and `` rewrote a little bit of it , '' but then she stated she felt like it was missing something , so she went back for a fourth time and layered it up with harmonies . `` Lust for Life '' was first registered at ASCAP under Del Rey 's name during March 2017 , with The Weeknd credited as a co-writer under his real name Abel Tesfaye . Later , Del Rey teased the collaboration on March 26 , 2017 via Twitter , with Tesfaye 's signature logo . The logo , which is also the logo of his record label XO , was also included in the Lust for Life album trailer .",

    "context": "In 2008 , a PCH spokesperson said the digital properties were intended to attract younger consumers . By 2013 , the internet had become PCH 's primary channel of interaction with consumers . The New York Times described the digital transition as `` part of an overall effort to collect information on Web users , show them advertisements and use the registration information for PCH 's mailing lists . '' PCH is a direct - marketing company that sells merchandise , magazine subscriptions and operates several prize - based websites . While best known for the sweepstakes and Prize Patrol it uses to promote its magazine subscriptions , the majority of the company 's revenue now comes from merchandise . The company has been selling books , media , jewelry and other consumer items since the 1980s . PCH operates eight websites , including PCH Search and Win , PCH Lotto , PCH Games , PCH Save and Win , and Candystand . The company also sells magazine subscriptions at a discount and advertises subscriptions along with its sweepstakes . It 's estimated that companies like PCH keep 75 - 90 percent of the fees from the original subscription , while publishers use the increased distribution to improve circulation numbers and revenue from renewals . PCH popularized the idea of using sweepstakes to sell magazine subscriptions in the direct - marketing market and became known by detractors as a producer of junk - mail for advertising through mass - mailings . Documents filed with the New York State Department in 1993 said that year the company mailed 220 million envelopes . Frequent buyers can receive 30 - 40 mailings a year .",

    "context": "Figure skating is a sport in which individuals , duos , or groups perform on figure skates on ice . It was the first winter sport included in the Olympics , in 1908 . The four Olympic disciplines are men 's singles , ladies ' singles , pair skating , and ice dance . Non-Olympic disciplines include synchronized skating , Theater on Ice , and four skating . From novice through senior - level competition , skaters generally perform two programs ( short and long ) which , depending on the discipline , may include spins , jumps , moves in the field , lifts , throw jumps , death spirals , and other elements or moves . The blade has a groove on the bottom creating two distinct edges -- inside and outside . Judges prefer that skaters glide on one edge of the blade and not on both at the same time , which is referred to as a flat edge . During a spin , skaters use the `` sweet spot '' of the blade , formally called a rocker , which is the roundest portion of the blade , just behind the pick and near the middle of the blade . Skates used in single and pair skating have a set of large , jagged teeth called toe picks on the front of the blade . Toe picks are mainly used for the take - off on jumps . Ice dance blades are an inch shorter in the rear and have smaller toe picks .",

    "question": "what is the function of pharyngeal pouches in aquatic chordates",
    "context": "Pharyngeal slits are filter - feeding organs found in Invertebrate chordates ( lancelets and tunicates ) and hemichordates living in aquatic environments . Pharyngeal slits are repeated openings that appear along the pharynx caudal to the mouth . With this position , they allow for the movement of water in the mouth and out the pharyngeal slits . It 's postulated that this is how pharyngeal slits first assisted in filter - feeding , and later with the addition of gills along their walls , aided in respiration of aquatic chordates . These repeated segments are controlled by similar developmental mechanisms . Some hemichordate species can have as many as 200 gill slits . Pharyngeal slits resembling gill slits are transiently present during the embryonic stages of tetrapod development . The presence of gill - like slits in the neck of the developing human embryo famously led Ernst Haeckel to postulate that `` ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny '' ; this hypothesis , while false , contains elements of truth , as explored by Stephen Jay Gould in Ontogeny and Phylogeny . However , it is now accepted that it is the vertebrate pharyngeal pouches and not the neck slits that are homologous to the pharyngeal slits of invertebrate chordates . Gill slits are , at some stage of life , found in all chordates . One theory of their origin is the fusion of nephridia which opened both on the outside and the gut , creating openings between the gut and the environment . In vertebrates , the pharyngeal arches are derived from all three germ layers . Neural crest cells enter these arches where they contribute to craniofacial features such as bone and cartilage . However , the existence of pharyngeal structures before neural crest cells evolved is indicated by the existence of neural crest - independent mechanisms of pharyngeal arch development . The first , most anterior pharyngeal arch gives rise to the oral jaw . The second arch becomes the hyoid and jaw support . In fish , the other posterior arches contribute to the brachial skeleton , which support the gills ; in tetrapods the anterior arches develop into components of the ear , tonsils , and thymus . The genetic and developmental basis of pharyngeal arch development is well characterized . It has been shown that Hox genes and other developmental genes such as dlx are important for patterning the anterior / posterior and dorsal / ventral axes of the branchial arches . Some fish species have jaws in their throat , known as pharyngeal jaws , which develop using the same genetic pathways involved in oral jaw formation .",

    "question": "who were the three singers who died in a plane crash",
    "context": "On February 3 , 1959 , rock and roll musicians Buddy Holly , Ritchie Valens , and J.P. `` The Big Bopper '' Richardson were killed in a plane crash near Clear Lake , Iowa , together with pilot Roger Peterson . The event later became known as `` The Day the Music Died '' , after singer - songwriter Don McLean referred to it as such in his 1971 song `` American Pie '' . At the time , Holly and his band , consisting of Waylon Jennings , Tommy Allsup , and Carl Bunch , were playing on the `` Winter Dance Party '' tour across the United States Midwest . Rising artists Valens and Richardson had joined the tour , as well . The long journeys between venues on board the cold , uncomfortable tour buses adversely affected the performers , with cases of flu and even frostbite . After stopping at Clear Lake to perform , and frustrated by such conditions , Holly chose to charter a plane to reach their next venue in Moorhead , Minnesota . Richardson , who had the flu , swapped places with Jennings , taking his seat on the plane , while Allsup lost his seat to Valens on a coin toss . Soon after takeoff , late at night and in poor , wintry weather conditions , the pilot lost control of the light aircraft , a Beechcraft Bonanza , which subsequently crashed into a cornfield . Everyone on board was killed . The event has since been mentioned in various songs and films . A number of monuments have been erected at the crash site and in Clear Lake , where an annual memorial concert is also held at the Surf Ballroom , the venue that hosted the artists ' last performance .",

    "question": "what is the uk flag made up of",
    "context": "The origins of the earlier flag of Great Britain date back to 1606 . James VI of Scotland had inherited the English and Irish thrones in 1603 as James I , thereby uniting the crowns of England , Scotland , and Ireland in a personal union , although the three kingdoms remained separate states . On 12 April 1606 , a new flag to represent this regal union between England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree , according to which the flag of England ( a red cross on a white background , known as St George 's Cross ) , and the flag of Scotland ( a white saltire on a blue background , known as the Saltire or St Andrew 's Cross ) , would be joined together , forming the flag of England and Scotland for maritime purposes . King James also began to refer to a `` Kingdom of Great Britaine '' , although the union remained a personal one . The present design of the Union Flag dates from a Royal proclamation following the union of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801 . The flag combines aspects of three older national flags : the red cross of St George for the Kingdom of England , the white saltire of St Andrew for Scotland ( which two were united in the first Union Flag ) , and the red saltire of St Patrick to represent Ireland . Notably , the home country of Wales is not represented separately in the Union Flag , as the flag was designed after the invasion of Wales in 1282 . Hence Wales as a home country today has no representation on the flag ; it appears under the cross of St George , which represents the former Kingdom of England ( which included Wales ) .",

    "context": "Arsenic and Old Lace is a 1944 American dark comedy film directed by Frank Capra , starring Cary Grant , and based on Joseph Kesselring 's play Arsenic and Old Lace . The script adaptation was by Julius J. Epstein and Philip G. Epstein . Capra actually filmed the movie in 1941 because of star Cary Grant 's availability , but it was not released until 1944 , after the original stage version had finished its run on Broadway . The lead role of Mortimer Brewster was originally intended for Bob Hope , but he could not be released from his contract with Paramount . Capra had also approached Jack Benny and Ronald Reagan before learning that Grant would accept the role . Boris Karloff played Jonathan Brewster , who `` looks like Karloff , '' on the Broadway stage , but he was unable to do the movie as well because he was still appearing in the play during filming , and Raymond Massey took his place . The film 's supporting cast also features Priscilla Lane , Jack Carson , Edward Everett Horton and Peter Lorre . Josephine Hull and Jean Adair portray the Brewster sisters , Abby and Martha , respectively . Hull and Adair , as well as John Alexander ( who played Teddy Brewster ) , were reprising their roles from the 1941 stage production . Hull and Adair both received an eight - week leave of absence from the stage production that was still running , but Karloff did not as he was an investor in the stage production and its main draw . The entire film was shot within those eight weeks . The film cost just over $1.2 million of a $2 million budget to produce .",

    "question": "what happened to the governor of the bastille",
    "context": "The permanent garrison of the Bastille , under de Launay , consisted of about 80 invalides ( veteran military pensioners ) no longer considered suitable for regular army service . Two days before 14 July they were reinforced by thirty Swiss grenadiers from the Salis - Samade Regiment . Unlike Sombreuil , the governor of Hôtel des Invalides , who had accepted the revolutionaries ' demands earlier that day , de Launay refused to surrender the prison fortress and hand over the arms and the gunpowder stored in the cellars . He promised that he would not fire unless attacked and tried to negotiate with two delegates from the Hôtel de Ville , but the discussions drew out . A part of the impatient crowd started to enter the outer courtyard of the fortress after a small group broke the chains securing the drawbridge . After shouting warnings the garrison opened fire . The besiegers interpreted this as treachery on the part of de Launay . The ensuing fighting lasted about four hours , resulting in about 100 casualties among the exposed crowd but only one death and three wounded amongst the well - protected defenders firing from loopholes and battlements . With no source of water and only limited food supplies within the Bastille , de Launay decided to capitulate on the condition that nobody from within the fortress would be harmed . In a note passed out through an opening in the drawbridge he threatened that he would blow up the entire fortress and the surrounding district if these conditions were rejected . De Launay 's conditions were rejected but he nevertheless capitulated , reportedly after members of the garrison prevented him from entering the cellars where the gunpowder was stored . At about 5pm firing from the fortress ceased and the drawbridge was suddenly lowered . De Launay was then seized and his sword and baton of rank torn from him . He was supposed to have been taken to the Hôtel de Ville by one of the leaders of the insurrection , soldier ( future general ) Pierre - Augustin Hulin . However on the way there , the furious crowd assaulted the governor , beat him and eventually lynched him by stabbing him repeatedly with their knives , swords and bayonets and shooting him once . The actual killing was reported to have taken place near the Hôtel de Ville when the struggling de Launay , desperate and abused , cried out `` Enough ! let me die . '' and kicked an unemployed cook named Desnot in the groin . After the killing , his head was sawn off by Mathieu Jouve Jourdan , a butcher . It was fixed on a pike to be carried through the streets for some hours before being thrown in the Seine the next day . Three officers of the Bastille 's permanent garrison and two of their veterans were also lynched while two of the Swiss were unaccounted for . However the majority of the defenders were escorted through the mob by French Guards who had joined the attackers , and eventually released . The history writer Simon Schama describes de Launay as a `` reasonably conscientious if somewhat dour '' functionary who treated prisoners more humanely than his predecessors had done . The Marquis de Sade who had been transferred from the Bastille to another prison shortly before 14 July , commented that de Launay was `` a so - called marquis whose grandfather was a servant '' .",

Claxton handled the majority of the remaining shows at 68 , while co-star Victor French helmed 18 . Maury Dexter ( who was often an assistant director ) and Leo Penn directed the remaining episodes at 21 and 3 episodes respectively .

In actuality the southern Minnesota landscape , where the show is supposed to take place , there are no tall mountains . The series theme song was titled The Little House and was written and conducted by David Rose . The ending theme music , also written by Rose , originally appeared as a piece of incidental music in a later - season episode of Michael Landon 's previous long - running series , Bonanza .",

    "context": "Green Eggs and Ham is a children 's book by Dr. Seuss , first published on August 12 , 1960 . As of 2016 , the book has sold 8 million copies worldwide . The story has appeared in several adaptations starting with 1973 's Dr. Seuss on the Loose starring Paul Winchell as the voice of both Sam - I - Am and the first - person narrator . A character named `` Sam - I - am '' pesters an unnamed character to try a plate of green eggs and ham . The unnamed character refuses , responding , `` I do not like green eggs and ham . I do not like them , Sam - I - am . '' He continues to repeat this as Sam persistently follows him , asking him to try them in eight locations ( house , box , car , tree , train , dark , rain , boat ) and with three animals ( mouse , fox , and goat ) . Finally , he gives into Sam 's pestering and tries the green eggs and ham , which he does like after all and happily responds , `` I do so like green eggs and ham . Thank you . Thank you , Sam - I - am . '' Green Eggs and Ham is one of Seuss 's `` Beginner Books '' , written in a very simple vocabulary for beginning readers . The vocabulary of the text consists of just 50 different words and was the result of a bet between Seuss and Bennett Cerf , Dr. Seuss 's publisher . that Seuss ( after completing The Cat in the Hat using 236 words ) could not complete an entire book without exceeding that limit . The 50 words are : a , am , and , anywhere , are , be , boat , box , car , could , dark , do , eat , eggs , fox , goat , good , green , ham , here , house , I , if , in , let , like , may , me , mouse , not , on , or , rain , Sam , say , see , so , thank , that , the , them , there , they , train , tree , try , will , with , would , you .",

    "question": "where was the old grey whistle test filmed",
    "context": "It was commissioned by David Attenborough and aired on BBC2 from 1971 to 1988 . It took over the BBC2 late night slot from Disco 2 , which ran between September 1970 and July 1971 , while continuing to feature non-chart music . The show was devised by BBC producer Rowan Ayers . The original producer , involved in an executive capacity throughout the show 's entire history , was Michael Appleton . According to presenter Bob Harris , the programme derived its name from a Tin Pan Alley phrase from years before . When they got the first pressing of a record they would play it to people they called the old greys -- doormen in grey suits . Any song they could remember and whistle , having heard it just once or twice , had passed the old grey whistle test . The show 's focus on `` serious '' rock music , rather than chart hits covered on BBC1 by Top of the Pops , was emphasised by a lack of showbiz glitter : bands would often perform their songs in front of either the bare studio walls or plain wooden boards ( actually the backs of set walls from other programmes filmed in the same studio ) . As with many BBC productions , this was ( initially at least ) as much a matter of money as of style ; other late night shows of the time , having only ' minority ' appeal , also had to be content with spartan sets . Another factor was that the programme was originally produced in a studio at BBC Television Centre in west London known as `` Pres B '' , which had been originally designed for shooting little more than in - vision continuity . The studio was only 32 by 22 feet ( 10 m × 7 m ) which left little room for a set once the cameras and band were in . The original opening credits were played over a naked dancing woman painted in green to Santana 's Jingo . When Richard Williams was replaced by ' Whispering ' Bob Harris , the series ' opening titles theme was changed to the now more famous animation of a male figure made up of stars ( known as the ' Star Kicker ' ) dancing . The programme 's title music , with its harmonica theme , was a track called `` Stone Fox Chase '' by a Nashville band , Area Code 615 .",

Glenn Miller and his orchestra recorded the tune several times , with a 1942 version reaching number nine on the singles chart . In 1960 , rhythm and blues singer Etta James recorded an arrangement by Riley Hampton that improvised on Warren 's melody . James ' version was the title track on her debut album At Last ! ( 1960 ) and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999 . Celine Dion and Beyoncé also had record chart successes with the song . Prior to release of Sun Valley Serenade , `` At Last '' was performed in the film by Glenn Miller and his orchestra , with vocals by John Payne and Lynn Bari , dubbed by Pat Friday . Studio head Darryl Zanuck reportedly said , `` There are too many big ones in this . Let 's save one for the next .

    "context": "World War I ( often abbreviated to WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War , the Great War , or the War to End All Wars , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . More than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history . Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war ( including the victims of a number of genocides ) , a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents ' technological and industrial sophistication , and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare . It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history and precipitated major political change , including the Revolutions of 1917 -- 1923 in many of the nations involved . Unresolved rivalries at the end of the conflict contributed to the start of the Second World War twenty - one years later . The war drew in all the world 's economic great powers , assembled in two opposing alliances : the Allies ( based on the Triple Entente of the Russian Empire , the French Third Republic , and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ) versus the Central Powers of Germany and Austria - Hungary . Although Italy was a member of the Triple Alliance alongside Germany and Austria - Hungary , it did not join the Central Powers , as Austria - Hungary had taken the offensive against the terms of the alliance . These alliances were reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war : Italy , Japan and the United States joined the Allies , while the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria joined the Central Powers .",

    "question": "who has the most super bowl losses in nfl history",
    "context": "Before the 1970 merger between the American Football League ( AFL ) and the National Football League ( NFL ) , the two leagues met in four such contests . The first two were marketed as the `` AFL -- NFL World Championship Game '' , but were also casually referred to as `` the Super Bowl game '' during the television broadcast . Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the `` Super Bowl '' moniker in official marketing ; the names `` Super Bowl I '' and `` Super Bowl II '' were retroactively applied to the first two games . The NFC / NFL leads in Super Bowl wins with 27 , while the AFC / AFL has won 25 . Twenty franchises , including teams that have relocated to another city , have won the Super Bowl . The Pittsburgh Steelers ( 6 -- 2 ) have won the most Super Bowls with six championships , while the New England Patriots ( 5 -- 5 ) , the Dallas Cowboys ( 5 -- 3 ) , and the San Francisco 49ers ( 5 -- 1 ) have five wins . New England has the most Super Bowl appearances with ten , while the Buffalo Bills ( 0 -- 4 ) have the most consecutive appearances with four ( all losses ) from 1990 to 1993 . The Miami Dolphins are the only other team to have at least three consecutive appearances : 1972 -- 1974 . The Denver Broncos ( 3 -- 5 ) and Patriots have each lost a record five Super Bowls . The Minnesota Vikings ( 0 -- 4 ) and the Bills have lost four . The record for consecutive wins is two and is shared by seven franchises : the Green Bay Packers ( 1966 -- 1967 ) , the Miami Dolphins ( 1972 -- 1973 ) , the Pittsburgh Steelers ( 1974 -- 1975 and 1978 -- 1979 , the only team to accomplish this feat twice ) , the San Francisco 49ers ( 1988 -- 1989 ) , the Dallas Cowboys ( 1992 -- 1993 ) , the Denver Broncos ( 1997 -- 1998 ) , and the New England Patriots ( 2003 -- 2004 ) . Among those , Dallas ( 1992 -- 1993 ; 1995 ) and New England ( 2001 ; 2003 -- 2004 ) are the only teams to win three out of four consecutive Super Bowls . The 1972 Dolphins capped off the only perfect season in NFL history with their victory in Super Bowl VII . The only team with multiple Super Bowl appearances and no losses is the Baltimore Ravens , who in winning Super Bowl XLVII defeated and replaced the 49ers in that position . Four current NFL teams have never appeared in a Super Bowl , including franchise relocations and renaming : the Cleveland Browns , Detroit Lions , Jacksonville Jaguars , and Houston Texans , though both the Browns ( 1964 ) and Lions ( 1957 ) had won NFL championship games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl .

As of July 2016 , the federal government mandates a nationwide minimum wage of $7.25 per hour . As of October 2016 , there are 29 states with a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum . From 2014 to 2015 , nine states increased their minimum wage levels through automatic adjustments , while increases in 11 other states occurred through referendum or legislative action . In real terms , the federal minimum wage peaked near $10.00 per hour in 1968 , using 2014 inflation - adjusted dollars . Beginning in January 2017 , Massachusetts and Washington state will have the highest minimum wages , Aside from Santa Fe NM , which is currently at $11.09 which is still # 1 for Highest Min Wage in the country . Massachusetts and Washington state come in # 2 . New York City 's minimum wage will be $15.00 per hour by the end of 2018 . There is a racial difference for support of a higher minimum wage with most black and Hispanic individuals supporting a $15.00 federal minimum wage , and 54 % of whites opposing it . In 2015 , about 3 percent of White , Asian , and Hispanic or Latino workers earned the federal minimum wage or less . Among Black workers , the percentage was about 4 percent .",

    "question": "when did the persons case start and end",
    "context": "The Famous Five , or The Valiant Five , ( French : Célèbres cinq ) were five Alberta women who asked the Supreme Court of Canada to answer the question , `` Does the word ' Persons ' in Section 24 of the British North America Act , 1867 , include female persons ? '' in the case Edwards v Canada . The five women , Emily Murphy , Irene Marryat Parlby , Nellie Mooney McClung , Louise Crummy McKinney and Henrietta Muir Edwards , created a petition to ask this question . They sought to have women legally considered persons so that women could be appointed to the Senate . The petition was filed on August 27 , 1927 , and on April 24 , 1928 , Canada 's Supreme Court summarized its unanimous decision that women are not such `` persons '' . The last line of the judgement reads , `` Understood to mean ' Are women eligible for appointment to the Senate of Canada , ' the question is answered in the negative . '' This judgement was overturned by the British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on October 18 , 1929 . This case came to be known as the `` Persons Case '' . Although Canadian women ( those who were British / Canadian citizens ) had the vote in many provinces and in federal elections by 1929 , the case was part of a continent - wide drive for political equality , coming seven years after discrimination against women 's voting rights was prohibited in the United States through the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , and thus had important ramifications .",

    "question": "who provided the voice for the geico insurance company gecko",
    "context": "Animated advertisements were part of the early GEICO Direct ads as well as the `` Dumb Things '' campaign . The 15 - second long commercials , animated by Bill Plympton , featured a curious little man walking up to an object and eventually getting hurt due to his curiosity of the object . One of the commercials , for example , involved him finding a cannon and pressing a button , causing a resulting cannonball to fire out and stick to his face . The original saying in the commercial was `` You could still save money on car insurance . Even if you made a few mistakes . '' ; later modified to `` We all do dumb things . Paying too much for car insurance does n't have to be one of them . '' The company 's ads sometimes focus on its reptilian mascot , The Gecko , an anthropomorphic Day Gecko created by The Martin Agency , modified in 2005 to a CGI character by Animation Director David Hulin and his team at Framestore . The gecko first appeared in 1999 , during the Screen Actors Guild strike that prevented the use of live actors . The original commercial features the Gecko , voiced by actor Kelsey Grammer , who climbs onto a microphone on a podium and utters `` This is my final plea : I am a gecko , not to be confused with GEICO , which could save you hundreds on car insurance . So , STOP CALLING ME ! '' , before licking his eye . Later `` wrong number '' ads used Dave Kelly as the voice of the gecko . In the subsequent commercials with Jake Wood ( which portray him as a representative of the company ) , the gecko speaks with a British Cockney accent , because it would be unexpected , according to Martin Agency 's Steve Bassett . In 2010s commercials , the gecko 's accent is more working - class , perhaps in an effort to further `` humanize '' him . `` As computer animation got better and as we got to know the character better , we did a few things , '' says Steve Bassett , creative director at The Martin Agency . `` We wanted to make him a little more guy - next - door . And he looks a lot more real than he 's looked before . '' Chelsea Clinton , daughter of former president Bill Clinton and then - Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton , interviewed the Geico Gecko in April 2013 . He had since became GEICO 's longest - running mascot , appearing in more than 150 commercials as of 2017 . Maxwell is an anthropomorphic talking pig and recurring character in GEICO advertisements . Maxwell debuted in an installment of the Rhetorical Questions campaign as the `` little piggy who cried ' wee wee wee ' all the way home '' ( referencing the famous nursery rhyme `` This Little Piggy '' ) being driven home by a friend 's mother , squealing along the way . While Maxwell was originally intended as a one - time character , the popularity of his debut commercial resulted in him being spun off into his own series of commercials which usually feature him as a tech - savvy , informative pig who is most concerned with his GEICO - related objects .",

    "context": "The Chickasaw ( / ˈtʃɪkəsɔː / CHIK - ə - saw ) are an indigenous people of the Southeastern Woodlands . Their traditional territory was in the Southeastern United States of Mississippi , Alabama , and Tennessee . They are of the Muskogean language family and are federally recognized as the Chickasaw Nation . Sometime prior to the first European contact , the Chickasaw migrated from western regions and moved east of the Mississippi River , where they settled mostly in present - day northeast Mississippi and into Lawrence County , Tennessee . That is where they encountered European explorers and traders , having relationships with French , English and Spanish during the colonial years . The United States considered the Chickasaw one of the Five Civilized Tribes , as they adopted numerous practices of European Americans . Resisting European - American settlers encroaching on their territory , they were forced by the US to sell their country in 1832 Treaty of Pontotoc Creek and move to Indian Territory ( Oklahoma ) during the era of Indian Removal in the 1830s .",

    "question": "what are the products of the breakdown of lactose",
    "context": "Several million tons are produced annually as a by - product of the dairy industry . Whey is made up of 6.5 % solids of which 4.8 % is lactose that may be purified by crystallisation . Whey or milk plasma is the liquid remaining after milk is curdled and strained , for example in the production of cheese . Lactose makes up about 2 -- 8 % of milk by weight . Industrially , lactose is produced from whey permeate -- that is whey filtrated for all major proteins . The protein fraction is used in infant nutrition and sport nutrition while the permeate can be evaporated to 60 -- 65 % solids and crystallized while cooling . Lactose can also be precipitated from whey using ethanol . Since it is insoluble in ethanol , lactose precipitates , in about 65 % yield . Infant mammals nurse on their mothers to drink milk , which is rich in lactose . The intestinal villi secrete the enzyme called lactase ( β - D - galactosidase ) to digest it . This enzyme cleaves the lactose molecule into its two subunits , the simple sugars glucose and galactose , which can be absorbed . Since lactose occurs mostly in milk , in most mammals , the production of lactase gradually decreases with maturity due to a lack of continuing consumption . Many people with ancestry in Europe , West Asia , South Asia , the Sahel belt in West Africa , East Africa and a few other parts of Central Africa maintain lactase production into adulthood . In many of these areas , milk from mammals such as cattle , goats , and sheep is used as a large source of food . Hence , it was in these regions that genes for lifelong lactase production first evolved . The genes of adult lactose tolerance have evolved independently in various ethnic groups . By descent , more than 70 % of western Europeans can drink milk as adults , compared with less than 30 % of people from areas of Africa , eastern and south - eastern Asia and Oceania . In people who are lactose intolerant , lactose is not broken down and provides food for gas - producing gut flora , which can lead to diarrhea , bloating , flatulence , and other gastrointestinal symptoms .",

    "question": "where did they film jingle all the way",
    "context": "Jingle All the Way is a 1996 American Christmas family comedy film directed by Brian Levant and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sinbad , with Phil Hartman , Rita Wilson , Jake Lloyd , James Belushi and Robert Conrad . The plot focuses on two rival fathers , workaholic Howard Langston ( Schwarzenegger ) and stressed out postal worker Myron Larabee ( Sinbad ) , both desperately trying to get a Turbo - Man action figure for their respective sons on a last minute shopping spree on Christmas Eve . Inspired by real - life Christmas toy sell - outs for products such as the Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers , the film was written by Randy Kornfield . Producer Chris Columbus rewrote the script , adding in elements of satire about the commercialization of Christmas , and the project was picked up by 20th Century Fox . Delays on Fox 's reboot of Planet of the Apes allowed Schwarzenegger to come on board the film , while Columbus opted to cast Sinbad ahead of Joe Pesci as Myron . Jingle All the Way was set and filmed in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul at a variety of locations , including the Mall of America . After five weeks filming , production moved to California where scenes such as the end parade were shot . The film 's swift production meant merchandising was limited to a replica of the Turbo - Man action figure used in the film . Although some critics felt the film was good family entertainment , it was met with a broadly negative response . Much criticism was attached to the film 's script , its focus on the commercialism of Christmas , Levant 's direction and Schwarzenegger 's performance . Nevertheless , it proved a success at the box office , generating $129 million worldwide , and it receives regular broadcasts on television during the Christmas season . In 2001 , Fox was ordered to pay $19 million to Murray Hill Publishing for stealing the idea for the film ; the verdict was overturned three years later .",

Only two shipwrecks were found that dated from the 8th century BC . However , archeologists have found forty - six shipwrecks dated from the 4th century BC , which would appear to indicate that there occurred a very large increase in the volume of trade between these centuries . Considering that the average ship tonnage also increased in the same period , the total volume of trade increased probably by a factor of 30 . Greece 's main exports were olive oil , wine , pottery , and metalwork . Imports included grains and pork from Sicily , Arabia , Egypt , Ancient Carthage , Bosporan Kingdom . While peasants and artisans often sold their own wares , there were also retail merchants known as kápêloi ( κάπηλοι ) . Grouped into guilds , they sold fish , olive oil , and vegetables . Women sold perfume or ribbons . Merchants were required to pay a fee for their space in the marketplace .

    "context": "It is in Committee ( s ) that bills get the most scrutiny and attention and that most of the work on a bill is done . Committees play an important role in the legislative process by providing members the opportunity to study , debate and amend the bill and the public with the opportunity to make comments on the bill . There are three types of House Committees , these are : 1 ) standing committees elected by members of the House , 2 ) select committees appointed by the Speaker of the House , and 3 ) joint committees whose members are chosen according to the statute or resolution that created that committee . As the House Rules limit the amount of floor debate on any given bill the committees play an important function in determining the final content and format of the bill . After the committee conducts any necessary research , and has debated and voted on any amendments that were offered in committee they may take one of three actions . These are reporting a measure to the full House with or without amendments , report the measure to the full House with a negative recommendation or fail to report the measure . The House may under certain rules remove the bill or measure from committee ( known as `` discharging the bill from committee '' ) if the committee fails to report the measure to the House Rules Committee or to the full House and a negative report to the full House does not terminate the bill . The phrase that a `` bill has been killed in committee '' is not completely accurate as the full House always has options under the rules to remove the bill from Committee and to take action .",

In genre , The Three Musketeers is primarily a historical and adventure novel . However , Dumas also frequently works into the plot various injustices , abuses , and absurdities of the old regime , giving the novel an additional political aspect at a time when the debate in France between republicans and monarchists was still fierce . The story was first serialised from March to July 1844 , during the July Monarchy , four years before the French Revolution of 1848 violently established the Second Republic . The author 's father , Thomas - Alexandre Dumas , had been a well - known General in France 's Republican army during the French Revolutionary Wars .",

    "context": "In cell biology , the cleavage furrow is the indentation of the cell 's surface that begins the progression of cleavage , by which animal and some algal cells undergo cytokinesis , the final splitting of the membrane , in the process of cell division . The same proteins responsible for muscle contraction , actin and myosin , begin the process of forming the cleavage furrow , creating an actomyosin ring . Other cytoskeletal proteins and actin binding proteins are involved in the procedure . Plant cells do not perform cytokinesis through this exact method but the two procedures are not totally different . Animal cells form an actin - myosin contractile ring within the equatorial region of the cell membrane that constricts to form the cleavage furrow . In plant cells , Golgi vesicle secretions form a cell plate or septum on the equatorial plane of the cell wall by the action of microtubules of the phragmoplast . The cleavage furrow in animal cells and the phragmoplast in plant cells are complex structures made up of microtubules and microfilaments that aide in the final separation of the cells into two identical daughter cells .",

    "context": "`` I Do n't Wanna Know '' is a song by American R&B artist Mario Winans , featuring a rap by P. Diddy , re-recorded background vocals by Enya and sampling the synthesizer riff from Enya 's song `` Boadicea '' . It reached number 1 in the United Kingdom and in Netherlands , and number 2 in the United States , stuck for eight consecutive weeks behind the Usher singles `` Yeah '' and `` Burn '' , respectively . It remains Winans ' only major success to date . As a result of its eight weeks at number 2 , `` I Do n't Wanna Know '' stands in joint fifth place for the most weeks at number 2 by a song which did not go to number 1 , behind Foreigner 's `` Waiting for a Girl Like You '' , Missy Elliott 's `` Work It '' , Donna Lewis 's `` I Love You Always Forever '' and Shania Twain 's `` You 're Still the One '' . The song is based on a sample of the Fugees ' 1996 hit single `` Ready or Not '' , which itself was based on a slowed - down sample of the instrumental track `` Boadicea '' by Enya from her 1987 album Enya . Winans said : `` I first heard ' Boadicea ' at the end of the movie Sleepwalkers about five or six years ago . It 's something I always wanted to produce . Then when The Fugees did it , oh my God , I loved it . ''",

    "context": "This is a list of host cities of the Olympic Games , both summer and winter , since the modern Olympics began in 1896 . Since then , summer games have usually -- but not always -- celebrated a four - year period known as an Olympiad . There have been 28 Summer Olympic Games held in 23 cities , and 23 Winter Olympic Games held in 20 cities . In addition , three summer and two winter editions of the Games were scheduled to take place but later cancelled due to war : Berlin ( summer ) in 1916 ; Tokyo / Helsinki ( summer ) and Sapporo / Garmisch - Partenkirchen ( winter ) in 1940 ; and London ( summer ) and Cortina d'Ampezzo , Italy ( winter ) in 1944 . The 1906 Summer Olympics were officially sanctioned and held in Athens . However , in 1949 , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) , decided to unrecognize the 1906 Games . Four cities have been chosen by the IOC to host upcoming Olympic Games : Tokyo for the 2020 Summer Olympics , Beijing for the 2022 Winter Olympics , Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics , and Los Angeles for the 2028 Summer Olympics . In 2022 , Beijing will become the only city that has held both the summer and the winter Olympic Games . Nine cities will have hosted the Olympic Games more than once : Athens ( 1896 and 2004 Summer Olympics ) , Paris ( 1900 , 1924 and 2024 Summer Olympics ) , London ( 1908 , 1948 and 2012 Summer Olympics ) , St. Moritz ( 1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics ) , Lake Placid ( 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics ) , Los Angeles ( 1932 , 1984 and 2028 Summer Olympics ) , Innsbruck ( 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics ) , Tokyo ( 1964 and 2020 Summer Olympics ) and Beijing ( 2008 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics ) . In addition , Stockholm hosted the 1912 Summer Olympics and the equestrian portion of the 1956 Summer Olympics . London became the first city to have hosted three Games with the 2012 Summer Olympics . Paris will become the second city to do this with the 2024 Summer Olympics , followed by Los Angeles as the third in 2028 . The United States has hosted a total of eight Olympic Games , more than any other country , followed by France with five editions . Canada , Germany , Italy , Japan , and the United Kingdom have each hosted three Games .",

    "context": "Seventy percent of smokers would like to quit smoking , and 50 percent report attempting to quit within the past year . Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death worldwide . Tobacco cessation significantly reduces the risk of dying from tobacco - related diseases such as coronary heart disease , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , and lung cancer . Due to its link to many chronic diseases , cigarette smoking has been restricted in many public areas . Many different strategies can be used for smoking cessation , including quitting without assistance ( `` cold turkey '' or cut down then quit ) , behavioral counseling , and medications such as bupropion , cytisine , nicotine replacement therapy , or varenicline . Most smokers who try to quit do so without assistance , though only 3 % to 6 % of quit attempts without assistance are successful . Behavioral counseling and Medications each increase the rate of successfully quitting smoking , and a combination of behavioral counseling with a medication such as bupropion is more effective than either intervention alone . Since nicotine is addictive , quitting smoking leads to symptoms of nicotine withdrawal such as nicotine cravings , anxiety , irritability , depression , and weight gain . Professional smoking cessation support methods generally attempt to address nicotine withdrawal symptoms to help the client break free of nicotine addiction .",

    "question": "where does the isbn number go on a book",
    "context": "Only the term `` ISBN '' should be used ; the terms `` eISBN '' and `` e-ISBN '' have historically been sources of confusion and should be avoided . If a book exists in one or more digital ( e-book ) formats , each of those formats must have its own ISBN . In other words , each of the three separate EPUB , Amazon Kindle , and PDF formats of a particular book will have its own specific ISBN . They should not share the ISBN of the paper version , and there is no generic `` eISBN '' which encompasses all the e-book formats for a title . Currently the barcodes on a book 's back cover ( or inside a mass - market paperback book 's front cover ) are EAN - 13 ; they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits called an EAN - 5 for the currency and the recommended retail price . For 10 digit ISBNs , the number `` 978 '' , the Bookland `` country code '' , is prefixed to the ISBN in the barcode data , and the check digit is recalculated according to the EAN13 formula ( modulo 10 , 1x and 3x weighting on alternate digits ) . Partly because of an expected shortage in certain ISBN categories , the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) decided to migrate to a thirteen - digit ISBN ( ISBN - 13 ) . The process began 1 January 2005 and was planned to conclude 1 January 2007 . As of 2011 , all the 13 - digit ISBNs began with 978 . As the 978 ISBN supply is exhausted , the 979 prefix was introduced . Part of the 979 prefix is reserved for use with the Musicland code for musical scores with an ISMN. 10 digit ISMN codes differed visually as they began with an `` M '' letter ; the bar code represents the `` M '' as a zero ( 0 ) , and for checksum purposes it counted as a 3 . All ISMNs are now 13 digits commencing 979 - 0 ; 979 - 1 to 979 - 9 will be used by ISBN .",

To avoid disgrace , she married wealthy Albert Frazer ( Philip Bond ) , developer of steamship technology and heir to the Frazer shipyards , a connection James soon turned to his own advantage . Elizabeth gave birth to a son , William Frazer . The marriage was unhappy and Albert took trips away on business , finally settling in South America where he died . Albert 's father died leaving his shipyards and shipping line to Elizabeth for William to inherit on coming of age so the Frazer 's name would live on .

    "context": "The story was first published in 1953 in the anthology The Avon Book of Modern Writing . In 1960 , it was collected in the anthology The House of Fiction , published by Charles Scribner 's Sons . `` A Good Man Is Hard to Find , '' because of its publication in many anthologies , became the most well known of O'Connor's works . A man named Bailey intends to take his family from Georgia to Florida for a summer vacation , but his mother , ( referred to as `` the grandmother '' in the story ) wants him to drive to East Tennessee , where the grandmother has friends ( `` connections '' ) . She argues that his children , John Wesley and June Star , have never been to East Tennessee , and she shows him a news article in the Atlanta Journal Constitution about an escaped murderer who calls himself The Misfit last seen in Florida . The next day , the grandmother wakes up early to hide her cat , Pitty Sing , in a basket on the floor in the back of the car . She is worried that the cat would die while they were gone . Bailey finds her sitting in the car , dressed in her best clothes and an ostentatious hat ; she says that if she should die in an accident along the road , she wants people to see her corpse and know she was refined and `` a lady . '' The Grandmother talks continuously during the trip , trying to engage her two rude grandchildren in games and telling them jokes and a story , about which June Star makes disdainful comments . She recalls her youth in the Old South , reminiscing about her courtships and how much better everything was in her time , when children were respectful and people `` did right then . '' When the family stops at an old diner outside of Timothy for lunch , she talks to the owner , Red Sammy , about The Misfit . He and the grandmother agree that things were much better in the past and that the world at present is degenerate ; she concurs with Sammy 's remark that `` a good man is hard to find . '' After the family returns to the road , the grandmother begins telling the children a story about a mysterious house nearby with a secret panel , a house she remembers from her childhood . This catches the children 's attention and they want to visit the house , so they harass their father until he reluctantly agrees to allow them just one side trip . As he drives them down a remote dirt road , the grandmother suddenly realizes that the house she was thinking of was actually in Tennessee , not Georgia . That shocking realization makes her involuntarily kick her feet which frightens the cat , causing it to spring from its hidden basket onto Bailey 's neck . Bailey then loses control of the car and it flips over , ending up in a ditch below the road , near Toomsboro . Only the children 's mother is injured ; the children are frantic with excitement , and the grandmother 's main concern is dealing with Bailey 's anger .",

The main result was the Treaty of Versailles with Germany , which in section 231 laid the guilt for the war on `` the aggression of Germany and her allies '' . This provision proved humiliating for Germany and set the stage for the expensive reparations Germany was intended to pay ( it paid only a small portion before reparations ended in 1931 ) . The five major powers ( France , Britain , Italy , Japan and the United States of America ) controlled the Conference . And the `` Big Four '' were the Prime Minister of France , Georges Clemenceau ; the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , David Lloyd George ; the President of the United States , Woodrow Wilson ; and the Prime Minister of Italy , Vittorio Emanuele Orlando . They met together informally 145 times and made all the major decisions , which in turn were ratified by the others . The conference began on January 18 , 1919 and with respect to its end date Professor Michael Neiberg has noted : Although the senior statesmen stopped working personally on the conference in June 1919 , the formal peace process did not really end until July 1923 , when the Treaty of Lausanne was signed `` .",

    "question": "what is it called when you vote a president out of office",
    "context": "A recall election ( also called a recall referendum or representative recall ) is a procedure by which voters can remove an elected official from office through a direct vote before that official 's term has ended . Recalls , which are initiated when sufficient voters sign a petition , have a history dating back to ancient Athenian democracy and feature in several contemporary constitutions . In indirect or representative democracy people 's representatives are elected and these representatives rule for a specific period of time . But if any representative comes to be perceived as not properly discharging their responsibilities , then they can be called back with the written request of specific number or proportion of voters . The Legislative Assembly of British Columbia enacted representative recall in 1995 . In that province , voters in a provincial riding can petition to have their representative in parliament removed from office , even if that MLA is also the premier . ( Holding a seat in the legislature is not constitutionally necessary to be premier , however . ) If enough registered voters sign the petition , the speaker of the legislature announces in parliament that the member has been recalled and the lieutenant governor drops the writ for a by - election as soon as possible , giving voters the opportunity to replace the politician in question . By January 2003 , 22 recall efforts had been launched . No one has been recalled so far , but one representative , Paul Reitsma , resigned in 1998 when it looked as if the petition to recall him would have enough signatures to spur a recall election . Reitsma resigned during the secondary verification stage and the recall count ended .",

    "context": "In February 2015 , the United States Department of Labor issued its final rule amending the definition of `` spouse '' under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 `` FMLA '' in response to the United States v. Windsor decision recognizing same - sex marriage . The new DOL rule became effective March 27 , 2015 . The revised definition of `` spouse '' extends FMLA leave rights and job protections to eligible employees in a same - sex marriage or a common - law marriage entered into in a state or jurisdiction where those statuses are legally recognized , regardless of the state in which the employee currently works or resides . Accordingly , even if an employer has employees working where same - sex or common - law marriage is not recognized , those employees ' spouses would trigger FMLA coverage if an employee was married in one of the many states that recognize same - sex marriage or common - law marriage .

    "context": "Thranduil and an elf army arrive in Dale and form an alliance with Bard in order to reclaim white gems that are part of the mountain treasure . Bard goes to the mountain and asks Thorin for the share of gold that he had previously promised the people of Laketown , but Thorin refuses . Gandalf arrives at Dale to warn Bard and Thranduil of the threat posed by Azog , but Thranduil dismisses him . Bilbo sneaks out of Erebor to hand the Arkenstone over to Thranduil and Bard so that they can trade it for the gems and gold they were promised and prevent a battle . When Bard and Thranduil 's armies gather at the gates of Erebor , offering to trade the Arkenstone for the Elven white gems and the portion of gold promised Laketown survivors , Thorin angrily refuses to believe they have the Arkenstone until Bilbo admits giving it away and chides Thorin for letting greed cloud his judgement . Outraged by what he sees as betrayal , Thorin nearly kills Bilbo , but Gandalf arrives at the gate and shames Thorin into releasing Bilbo . Thorin 's cousin Dáin arrives with his Dwarf army , and a battle of Dwarves against Elves and Men begins , with the Elves and Men having a significant advantage . Wereworms emerge from the ground , releasing Azog 's army from their tunnels . With the Orcs outnumbering Dáin 's army , Thranduil and Bard 's forces , along with Gandalf and Bilbo , join the battle . However , a second front is opened when many Orcs , Ogres , and Trolls attack Dale . Inside Erebor , Thorin suffers traumatic hallucinations before regaining his sanity and leading his company to join the battle . He rides towards Ravenhill with Dwalin , Fíli , and Kíli to kill Azog ; Bilbo follows them using the One Ring to move through the combat unseen . Meanwhile , Tauriel leaves with Legolas following her to warn the Dwarves of Bolg 's approaching army . Fíli and Kíli are cornered . Azog kills Fíli , as Bilbo and the other Dwarves look on . As Thorin engages Azog in a fight to the death , Bolg knocks Bilbo unconscious , overpowers Tauriel and then kills Kíli , who had come to her aid . Legolas battles Bolg and eventually kills him . Thorin kills Azog , but is fatally wounded in the process . The Great Eagles then arrive with Radagast and Beorn to fight the newly arriving Orc army , and the Orcs are finally defeated . Bilbo regains consciousness and makes peace with Thorin before he dies . Tauriel mourns Kili and Thranduil acknowledges their love . Legolas then tells Thranduil he must leave , and Thranduil advises him to seek out a Dunedain ranger in the north who goes by the name `` Strider '' . Thorin , Fíli , and Kíli are respectfully laid to rest and Dáin is crowned King under the Mountain . Bilbo bids farewell to the remaining members of Thorin 's company and journeys home to the Shire with Gandalf . As the two part ways on the outskirts of the Shire , Gandalf admits his knowledge of Bilbo 's ring and warns him that magic rings are not to be used lightly . Bilbo returns to Bag End to find his belongings being auctioned off by his least favourite relatives , the Sackville - Bagginses , because he was presumed dead . He cancels the sale , but finds his home pillaged . He starts to tidy up and takes the Ring out of his pocket . Sixty years later , Bilbo receives a visit from Gandalf on his 111th birthday .",

    "context": "The episode was initially conceived as having a male protagonist with Andrea Riseborough reading the script with another part in mind . However , after Riseborough liked the journey of the protagonist and asked if the part could be rewritten as a woman , the script was altered in order to accommodate Riseborough . Both Brooker and executive producer Annabel Jones described the change as interesting , with Jones noting that `` How often do you see a mother reduced to this level of desperation ? '' on television . The episode was shot in Iceland and includes scenes filmed in the Harpa concert hall . Brooker had originally called out for filming in Scotland in his script , but Netflix suggested Iceland as a `` more stunning backdrop '' , according to Brooker . During filming , Iceland had its largest snowfall in forty years , which required them to add one line of dialogue to comment on the change of weather to account for the sudden snow accumulation . In May 2017 , a Reddit post unofficially announced the names and directors of the six episodes in series 4 of Black Mirror . The first trailer for the series was released by Netflix on 25 August 2017 , and contained the six episode titles .",

    "context": "Guiding values of the Indian constitution : a ) We , the people of India b ) Sovereign c ) Socialist d ) Secular e ) Democratic f ) Republic g ) Justice h ) Liberty I ) Equality j ) Fraternity The Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles had their origins in the Indian independence movement , which strove to achieve the values of liberty and social welfare as the goals of an independent Indian state . The development of constitutional rights in India was inspired by historical documents such as England 's Bill of Rights , the United States Bill of Rights and France 's Declaration of the Rights of Man . The demand for civil liberties formed an important part of the Indian independence movement , with one of the objectives of the Indian National Congress ( INC ) being to end discrimination between the British rulers and their Indian subjects . This demand was explicitly mentioned in resolutions adopted by the INC between 1917 and 1919 . The demands articulated in these resolutions included granting to Indians the rights to equality before law , free speech , trial by juries composed at least half of Indian members , political power , and equal terms for bearing arms as British citizens . The experiences of the First World War , the unsatisfactory Montagu -- Chelmsford Reforms of 1919 , and the rise to prominence of M.K. Gandhi in the Indian independence movement marked a change in the attitude of its leaders towards articulating demands for civil rights . The focus shifted from demanding equality of status between Indians and the British to assuring liberty for all Indians . The Commonwealth of India Bill , drafted by Annie Beasant in 1925 , specifically included demands for seven fundamental rights -- individual liberty , freedom of conscience , free expression of opinion , freedom of assembly , non-discrimination on the ground of sex , free elementary education and free use of public spaces . In 1927 , the INC resolved to set up a committee to draft a `` Swaraj Constitution '' for India based on a declaration of rights that would provide safeguards against oppression . The 11 - member committee , led by Motilal Nehru , was constituted in 1928 . Its report made a number of recommendations , including proposing guaranteed fundamental rights to all Indians . These rights resembled those of the American Constitution and those adopted by post-war European countries , and several of them were adopted from the 1925 Bill . Several of these provisions were later replicated in various parts of the Indian Constitution , including the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles .",

    "question": "who can be dismissed through a process of impreachment",
    "context": "The Constitution defines impeachment at the federal level and limits impeachment to `` The President , Vice President , and all civil officers of the United States '' who may be impeached and removed only for `` treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors '' . Several commentators have suggested that Congress alone may decide for itself what constitutes a `` high crime or misdemeanor '' , especially since Nixon v. United States stated that the Supreme Court did not have the authority to determine whether the Senate properly `` tried '' a defendant . In 1970 , then - House Minority Leader Gerald R. Ford defined the criterion as he saw it : `` An impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history . '' The central question regarding the Constitutional dispute about the impeachment of members of the legislature is whether members of Congress are officers of the United States . The Constitution grants the House the power to impeach `` The President , the Vice President , and all civil Officers of the United States . '' It has been suggested that members of Congress are not officers of the United States . Others , however , believe that members are civil officers and are subject to impeachment . The House of Representatives impeached Senator William Blount in 1798 , resulting in his expulsion . However , after initially hearing his impeachment , charges were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction . Left unsettled was the question whether members of Congress were civil officers of the United States . The House has not impeached a Member of Congress since Blount . As each House has the authority to expel its own members without involving the other chamber , expulsion has been the method used for removing Members of Congress .",

Ebenezer Butterick launched The Butterick Company in 1863 to create heavy cardboard templates for children 's clothing . Butterick 's innovation was offering every pattern in a series of standard , graded sizes . Members of his family cut and folded the first patterns that were sold from their home . In 1866 Butterick began manufacturing patterns for women 's fashions , and later added some articles of men 's clothing . They began publishing the fashion magazine The Delineator in 1873 to publicize their patterns . Their patterns started as unprinted tissue paper cut to shape , folded and held together by a pinned ( later pasted - on ) label with an image and , later , brief instructions . In the early 1900s they began to use an envelope to hold the pattern . In the late 1910s they introduced a separate instruction sheet , called the `` Deltor '' ( from the first three and last three letters of Delineator ) . In 1948 , they purchased two new presses specially designed to print markings directly onto the pattern tissue .",

    "question": "descendants of the maroons can be found in four major communities",
    "context": "Due to tensions and repeated conflicts with Maroons , the Second Maroon War erupted in 1795 . In an effort to break up the Maroon communities , the colonial government deported approximately 600 captive maroons to Nova Scotia . Due to their difficulties and those of Black Loyalists settled at Nova Scotia and England after the American Revolution , Great Britain established a colony in Sierra Leone in West Africa . It offered ethnic Africans a chance to set up their own community there , beginning in 1792 . Around 1800 a number of Jamaican Maroons were transported to Freetown , the first settlement of Sierra Leone . The only Leeward Maroon settlement that retained formal autonomy on Jamaica after the Second Maroon War was Accompong , in Saint Elizabeth Parish , whose people had abided by their 1739 treaty with the British . A Windward Maroon community is also located at Charles Town , on Buff Bay River in Portland Parish . Another is at Moore Town ( formerly Nanny Town ) , also in the parish of Portland . In 2005 the music of the Moore Town Maroons was declared by UNESCO as a ' Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity . ' A fourth community is at Scotts Hall , also Portland Parish . Accompong 's autonomy was ratified by the government of Jamaica when the island gained independence in 1962 . The government has tried to encourage survival of the other Maroon settlements . Since 2008 , the Jamaican government and Maroon communities have held the Annual International Maroon Conference at rotating communities around the island . Maroons from other Caribbean , Central and South America nations are invited . In 2016 Accompong 's colonel and a delegation traveled to the Kingdom of Ashanti in Ghana to renew ties with the Akan and Asante people of their ancestors .",

Initially intended for use inside the Bell System , AT&T licensed Unix to outside parties from the late 1970s , leading to a variety of both academic and commercial variants of Unix from vendors such as the University of California , Berkeley ( BSD ) , Microsoft ( Xenix ) , IBM ( AIX ) and Sun Microsystems ( Solaris ) . AT&T finally sold its rights in Unix to Novell in the early 1990s , which then sold its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation ( SCO ) in 1995 , but the UNIX trademark passed to the industry standards consortium The Open Group , which allows the use of the mark for certified operating systems compliant with the Single UNIX Specification ( SUS ) . Among these is Apple 's macOS , which is the Unix version with the largest installed base as of 2014 .",

    "question": "where did the stone for the tower of london come from",
    "context": "The White Tower , not including its projecting corner towers , measures 36 by 32 metres ( 118 by 105 ft ) at the base , and is 27 m ( 90 ft ) high at the southern battlements . The structure was originally three storeys high , comprising a basement floor , an entrance level , and an upper floor . The entrance , as is usual in Norman keeps , was above ground , in this case on the south face , and accessed via a wooden staircase which could be removed in the event of an attack . It was probably during Henry II 's reign ( 1154 -- 1189 ) that a forebuilding was added to the south side of the tower to provide extra defences to the entrance , but it has not survived . Each floor was divided into three chambers , the largest in the west , a smaller room in the north - east , and the chapel taking up the entrance and upper floors of the south - east . At the western corners of the building are square towers , while to the north - east a round tower houses a spiral staircase . At the south - east corner there is a larger semi-circular projection which accommodates the apse of the chapel . As the building was intended to be a comfortable residence as well as a stronghold , latrines were built into the walls , and four fireplaces provided warmth . The main building material is Kentish rag - stone , although some local mudstone was also used . Caen stone was imported from northern France to provide details in the Tower 's facing , although little of the original material survives as it was replaced with Portland stone in the 17th and 18th centuries . As most of the Tower 's windows were enlarged in the 18th century , only two original -- albeit restored -- examples remain , in the south wall at the gallery level . The tower was terraced into the side of a mound , so the northern side of the basement is partially below ground level . As was typical of most keeps , the bottom floor was an undercroft used for storage . One of the rooms contained a well . Although the layout has remained the same since the tower 's construction , the interior of the basement dates mostly from the 18th century when the floor was lowered and the pre-existing timber vaults were replaced with brick counterparts . The basement is lit through small slits .",

Influenced by the doctrine of `` natural right '' , the rights of man are held to be universal : valid at all times and in every place , pertaining to human nature itself . It became the basis for a nation of free individuals protected equally by the law . It is included in the beginning of the constitutions of both the Fourth French Republic ( 1946 ) and Fifth Republic ( 1958 ) and is still current . Inspired by the Enlightenment philosophers , the Declaration was a core statement of the values of the French Revolution and had a major impact on the development of freedom and democracy in Europe and worldwide .

    "context": "Levinson and Link then adapted the TV drama into the stage play Prescription : Murder . This was first performed at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco on January 2 , 1962 , with Oscar - winning character actor Thomas Mitchell in the role of Columbo . Mitchell was 70 years old at the time . The stage production starred Joseph Cotten as the murderer and Agnes Moorehead as the victim . Mitchell died of cancer while the play was touring in out - of - town tryouts ; Columbo was his last role . In 1968 , the same play was made into a two - hour television movie that aired on NBC . The writers suggested Lee J. Cobb and Bing Crosby for the role of Columbo , but Cobb was unavailable and Crosby turned it down because he felt it would take too much time away from the golf links . Director Richard Irving convinced Levinson and Link that Falk , who wanted the role , could pull it off even though he was much younger than the writers had in mind . Originally a one - off TV - Movie - of - the - Week , Prescription : Murder has Falk 's Columbo pitted against a psychiatrist ( Gene Barry ) . Due to the success of this film , NBC requested that a pilot for a potential series be made to see if the character could be sustained on a regular basis , leading to the 1971 hour and a half film , Ransom for a Dead Man , with Lee Grant playing the killer . The popularity of the second film prompted the creation of a regular series on NBC , that premiered in the fall of 1971 as part of The NBC Mystery Movie wheel series rotation : McCloud , McMillan & Wife , and other whodunits .",

    "question": "who sang sha na na na hey hey hey goodbye",
    "context": "`` Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye '' is a song written and recorded by Paul Leka , Gary DeCarlo and Dale Frashuer , attributed to a then - fictitious band they named `` Steam '' . It was released under the Mercury subsidiary label Fontana and became a number one pop single on the Billboard Hot 100 in late 1969 , and remained on the charts in early 1970 . In 1977 , Chicago White Sox organist Nancy Faust began playing the song when White Sox sluggers knocked out the opposing pitcher . The fans would sing and a sports ritual was born . The song 's chorus remains well - known , and is still frequently used as a crowd chant at many sporting events . It is generally directed at the losing side in an elimination contest when the outcome is all but certain or when an individual player is ejected or disqualified . It has also been observed by crowds in political rallies to drown out and mock disruptive protesters who are being escorted out by security . Paul Leka , Gary DeCarlo and Dale Frashuer wrote a blues shuffle version of the song in the early 1960s when they were members of a doo - wop group from Bridgeport , Connecticut , called the Glenwoods , the Citations , and the Chateaus , of which Leka was the piano player . The group disbanded when Leka talked Frashuer into going into New York City with him to write and possibly produce . In 1968 , DeCarlo recorded four songs at Mercury Records in New York with Leka as producer . The singles impressed the company 's executives , who wanted to issue all of them as A-side singles . In need of a B - side , Leka and DeCarlo resurrected an old song from their days as the Glenwoods , `` Kiss Him Goodbye '' , with their old bandmate , Frashuer .",

    "question": "new imperialism in europe was dominated by what countries",
    "context": "The Berlin Conference of 1884 -- 1885 sought to destroy the competition between the powers by defining `` effective occupation '' as the criterion for international recognition of a territory claim , specifically in Africa . The imposition of direct rule in terms of `` effective occupation '' necessitated routine recourse to armed force against indigenous states and peoples . Uprisings against imperial rule were put down ruthlessly , most spectacularly in the Herero Wars in German South - West Africa from 1904 to 1907 and the Maji Maji Rebellion in German East Africa from 1905 to 1907 . One of the goals of the conference was to reach agreements over trade , navigation , and boundaries of Central Africa . However , of all of the 15 nations in attendance of the Berlin Conference , none of the countries represented were African . The main dominating powers of the conference were France , Germany , Great Britain and Portugal . They remapped Africa without considering the cultural and linguistic borders that were already established . At the end of the conference , Africa was divided into 50 different colonies . The attendants established who was in control of each of these newly divided colonies . They also planned , noncommittally , to end the slave trade in Africa . In Britain , the age of new imperialism marked a time for significant economic changes . Because the country was the first to industrialize , Britain was technologically ahead of many other countries throughout the majority of the nineteenth century . However , by the end of the nineteenth century , other countries such as Germany , the United States , Russia , and Italy soon matched Britain in technological and thus , economic , power . After several decades of monopoly , the country was battling to maintain a dominant economic position while other powers became more involved in international markets . In 1870 , Britain contained 31.8 % of the world 's manufacturing capacity while the United States contained 23.3 % and Germany contained 13.2 % . By 1910 , Britain 's manufacturing capacity had dropped to 14.7 % while that of the United States had risen to 35.3 % and that of Germany to 15.9 % . As countries like Germany and America became more economically successful , they began to become more involved with imperialism , resulting in the British struggling to maintain the volume of British trade and investment overseas .",

    "context": "By 1990 , Michael had grown weary of the pressures of fame , telling the Los Angeles Times , `` At some point in your career , the situation between yourself and the camera reverses . For a certain number of years , you court it and you need it , but ultimately , it needs you more and it 's a bit like a relationship . The minute that happens , it turns you off ... and it does feel like it is taking something from you . '' He decided that he no longer wanted to do photo shoots or music videos , saying , `` I would like to never step in front of a camera again . '' Although he relented and decided to make a video for his new song , he still refused to appear in it . Instead , inspired by Peter Lindbergh 's now - iconic portrait of Naomi Campbell , Linda Evangelista , Tatjana Patitz , Christy Turlington , and Cindy Crawford for the January 1990 cover of the British edition of Vogue , Michael asked the five models to appear in the video . While it was not uncommon at the time for models to appear in music videos , usually such models played the love interest of the singer , as with Christie Brinkley 's appearance in her future husband Billy Joel 's `` Uptown Girl '' video , or Turlington 's appearance in Duran Duran 's `` Notorious '' video when she was 17 years old . For `` Freedom ! ' 90 '' , the five models would not portray Michael 's on - screen girlfriends , but would lip - synch the song in his place . Evangelista took some persuading before agreeing to appear in the video , saying , `` He thought it would make us into a big deal , that it would be good for us . I was like , ' Please , we 're here . We 've already arrived ! ' '' After speaking with Michael , she was convinced , and rearranged her schedule . In a 2015 Vanity Fair article , Evangelista reflected on her decision positively , saying , `` Little did I know that to this day , when someone meets me for the first time , they bring up that video . That 's what they remember . So yeah , George was right . '' An initial disagreement over their salaries was resolved when Annie Veltri , who represented Crawford , Evangelista , Campbell , and Patitz at Elite Model Management , made it clear that all of her clients would receive the same compensation -- $15,000 a day .",

    "context": "Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island , then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu . His father Jainulabdeen was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque ; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife . His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi . Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family . His ancestors had been wealthy traders and landowners , with numerous properties and large tracts of land . Their business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka , as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban . As a result , the family acquired the title of `` Mara Kalam Iyakkivar '' ( wooden boat steerers ) , which over the years became shortened to `` Marakier . '' With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914 , however , the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost over time , apart from the ancestral home . By his early childhood , Kalam 's family had become poor ; at an early age , he sold newspapers to supplement his family 's income . In his school years , Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn . He spent hours on his studies , especially mathematics . After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School , Ramanathapuram , Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph 's College , Tiruchirappalli , then affiliated with the University of Madras , from where he graduated in physics in 1954 . He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology . While Kalam was working on a senior class project , the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days . Kalam met the deadline , impressing the Dean , who later said to him , `` I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline '' . He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot , as he placed ninth in qualifiers , and only eight positions were available in the IAF . APJ Abdul Kalam",

In humans , other mammals , and birds , the heart is divided into four chambers : upper left and right atria ; and lower left and right ventricles . Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart . Fish , in contrast , have two chambers , an atrium and a ventricle , while reptiles have three chambers . In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves , which prevent backflow .

    "question": "what are some examples of enzymes in biology",
    "context": "The discovery that enzymes could be crystallized eventually allowed their structures to be solved by x-ray crystallography . This was first done for lysozyme , an enzyme found in tears , saliva and egg whites that digests the coating of some bacteria ; the structure was solved by a group led by David Chilton Phillips and published in 1965 . This high - resolution structure of lysozyme marked the beginning of the field of structural biology and the effort to understand how enzymes work at an atomic level of detail . An enzyme 's name is often derived from its substrate or the chemical reaction it catalyzes , with the word ending in - ase . Examples are lactase , alcohol dehydrogenase and DNA polymerase . Different enzymes that catalyze the same chemical reaction are called isozymes . The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology have developed a nomenclature for enzymes , the EC numbers ; each enzyme is described by a sequence of four numbers preceded by `` EC '' , which stands for `` Enzyme Commission '' . The first number broadly classifies the enzyme based on its mechanism .",

    "question": "when do you cut the rosca de reyes",
    "context": "Although the name indicates that it should be round , the roscón de reyes generally has an oval shape due to the need to make cakes larger than 30 cm ( 12 inches ) across for larger parties . Recipes vary from country to country . For decoration , figs , quinces , cherries or dried and candied fruits are used . It is traditionally eaten on January 6 , during the celebration of the Día de Reyes ( literally `` Kings ' Day '' ) , which commemorates the arrival of the three Magi or Wise Men . In most of Spain , Spanish America , and sometimes , Hispanic communities in the United States , this is the day when children traditionally get presents , which are attributed to the Three Wise Men ( and not Santa Claus or Father Christmas ) . In Spain before children go to bed , they leave a dish filled with biscuits and a few glasses of water for the three wise men and the camels they ride on . The baby Jesus hidden in the bread represents the flight of the Holy Family , fleeing from King Herod 's Massacre of the Innocents . Whoever finds the baby Jesus figurine is blessed and must take the figurine to the nearest church on February 2 ( Candlemas Day , Día de la Candelaria ) . In the Mexican culture , this person has the responsibility of hosting a dinner and providing tamales and atole to the guests . In U.S. communities with large Mexican and Mexican - American populations , such as Los Angeles , San Diego , San Jose , Dallas and Chicago , the celebration includes the Mexican hominy stew pozole , which is made for all one 's neighbors . In Spain , roscones bought in pastry shops have a small figure hidden inside , either of a baby Jesus or little toys for children , as well as the more traditional dry fava bean . Whoever finds the figure is crowned `` king '' or `` queen '' of the celebration , whereas whoever finds the bean has to pay for the next year 's roscón or Epiphany party .",

    "context": "The film employed many actors from the Irish theatre , including Barry Fitzgerald 's brother , Arthur Shields , as well as extras from the Irish countryside , and it is one of the few Hollywood movies in which the Irish language can be heard . Filming commenced on June 7 , 1951 . All of the outdoor scenes were shot on location in Ireland in County Mayo and County Galway . The inside scenes were filmed toward the end of July at the Republic Studios in Hollywood . The story is set in the fictitious community of Inisfree . This is not the same as the Lake Isle of Innisfree , a place in Lough Gill on the Sligo -- Leitrim border made famous by poet William Butler Yeats , which is a tiny island . Many scenes for the film were actually shot in and around the village of Cong , County Mayo , on the grounds of Cong 's Ashford Castle . Cong is now a wealthy small town and the castle a 5 - star luxury hotel . The connections with the film have led to the area becoming a tourist attraction . In 2008 , a pub opened in the building used as the pub in the film ( it had actually been a shop at the time when the movie was shot ) ; the pub hosts daily re-runs of the film on DVD . The Quiet Man Fan Club holds its annual general meeting in Ashford Castle . Other locations in the film include Thoor Ballylee , Co . Galway , home of poet W.B. Yeats for a period , Ballyglunin railway station near Tuam Co . Galway , which was filmed as Castletown station , and various places in Connemara Co . Galway and Co . Mayo . Among those are Lettergesh beach , where the horse race scene was filmed , the Quiet Man Bridge , signposted off the N59 road between Maam Cross and Oughterard and the `` White O'Morn '' cottage . The latter is located on R336 south of Maam , but has long ago fallen into ruin .",

    "question": "three kinds of tissues do meristems develop into",
    "context": "Differentiated plant cells generally can not divide or produce cells of a different type . Meristematic cells are incompletely or not at all differentiated , and are capable of continued cellular division . Therefore , cell division in the meristem is required to provide new cells for expansion and differentiation of tissues and initiation of new organs , providing the basic structure of the plant body . Furthermore , the cells are small and protoplasm fills the cell completely . The vacuoles are extremely small . The cytoplasm does not contain differentiated plastids ( chloroplasts or chromoplasts ) , although they are present in rudimentary form ( proplastids ) . Meristematic cells are packed closely together without intercellular cavities . The cell wall is a very thin primary cell wall as well as some are thick in some plants . Maintenance of the cells requires a balance between two antagonistic processes : organ initiation and stem cell population renewal . There are three types of meristematic tissues : apical ( at the tips ) , intercalary ( in the middle ) and lateral ( at the sides ) . At the meristem summit , there is a small group of slowly dividing cells , which is commonly called the central zone . Cells of this zone have a stem cell function and are essential for meristem maintenance . The proliferation and growth rates at the meristem summit usually differ considerably from those at the periphery . The term meristem was first used in 1858 by Carl Wilhelm von Nägeli ( 1817 -- 1891 ) in his book Beiträge zur Wissenschaftlichen Botanik ( `` Contributions to Scientific Botany '' ) . It is derived from the Greek word merizein ( μερίζειν ) , meaning to divide , in recognition of its inherent function .",

Written and co-produced by the band , the song is about following dreams and making an impact on the world . The song has been licensed for use in various media since its release . The Script frontman Danny O'Donoghue first met will.i.am while they were both judges for The Voice UK . O'Donoghue told : `` I played Will a few demos backstage early on in The Voice . We got to Hall Of Fame and he immediately asked if he could have it for his new album , as it was exactly what he was looking for . I was n't having it , it was our lead single but I asked if he 'd be on it . He agreed and we booked in time to record it . The problem is , he 's either late or completely flakes , so it took four attempts to get to record his part . Eventually we put it together in his hotel room in 15 minutes . It 's a classic duet , I do one line and he responds . '' He added : `` we went to the recording studio and an hour and a half later we had the song in its entirety . I thought he was going to produce it but he just gave it to me and Mark ( Sheehan ) and said ' you guys go and produce it ' . '' Of the collaboration O'Donoghue said : `` We were trying to play it super cool - us with will.i.am ! We heard him singing some of our lines , but we still did n't know what he was going to do .

    "context": "Article 35 ( 4 ) of the Constitution protects individuals from self - implication . Therefore , warnings must be read out to the detained man ( but not to women ) if he wants to voluntarily confess to the charges ; in this case , a Magistrate must read and explain the confessor 's right to silence and protection from self - implication , and attest to the fact that the rights of the confessor were read out to him and explained , and the confessor waived his right of silence . In Canada , the right to silence is protected under section 7 and section 11 ( c ) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . The accused may not be compelled as a witness against himself in criminal proceedings , and therefore only voluntary statements made to police are admissible as evidence . Prior to an accused being informed of their right to legal counsel , any statements they make to police are considered involuntarily compelled and are inadmissible as evidence . After being informed of the right to counsel , the accused may choose to voluntarily answer questions and those statements would be admissible . These rights to silence exist only when the suspect is knowingly dealing with a person in authority . When the subject is unaware he is dealing with the police , such as in the case of an undercover operation , these protections do not exist . Statements made to police officers during undercover operations are almost always allowed into evidence unless the conduct of the police was deemed so egregious that it would shock the community .",

They were first used to denote the effective sex of plants ( i.e. sex of individual in a given crossbreed , since most plants are hermaphroditic ) by Carl Linnaeus in 1751 .

    "context": "The history of basketball began with its invention in 1891 in Springfield , Massachusetts by Canadian physical education instructor James Naismith as a less injury - prone sport than football . The game became established fairly quickly and grew very popular as the 20th century progressed , first in America and then throughout the world . After basketball became established in American colleges , the professional game followed . The American National Basketball Association ( NBA ) , established in 1946 , grew to a multibillion - dollar enterprise by the end of the century , and basketball became an integral part of American culture . The game of basketball as it is known today was created by Dr. James Naismith in December 1891 in Springfield , Massachusetts , to condition young athletes during cold months . It consisted of peach baskets and a soccer style ball . He published 13 rules for the new game . He divided his class of eighteen into two teams of nine players each and set about to teach them the basics of his new game . The objective of the game was to throw the basketball into the fruit baskets nailed to the lower railing of the gym balcony . Every time a point was scored , the game was halted so the janitor could bring out a ladder and retrieve the ball . After a while , the bottoms of the fruit baskets were removed . The first public basketball game was played in Springfield , Massachusetts , on March 11 , 1892 .",

    "context": "The Ogallala Aquifer is a shallow water table aquifer surrounded by sand , silt , clay and gravel located beneath the Great Plains in the United States . One of the world 's largest aquifers , it underlies an area of approximately 174,000 sq mi ( 450,000 km ) in portions of eight states ( South Dakota , Nebraska , Wyoming , Colorado , Kansas , Oklahoma , New Mexico , and Texas ) . It was named in 1898 by geologist N.H. Darton from its type locality near the town of Ogallala , Nebraska . The aquifer is part of the High Plains Aquifer System , and rests on the Ogallala Formation , which is the principal geologic unit underlying 80 % of the High Plains . Large scale extraction for agricultural purposes started after World War II due partially to center pivot irrigation and to the adaptation of automotive engines for groundwater wells . Today about 27 % of the irrigated land in the entire United States lies over the aquifer , which yields about 30 % of the ground water used for irrigation in the United States . The aquifer is at risk for over-extraction and pollution . Since 1950 , agricultural irrigation has reduced the saturated volume of the aquifer by an estimated 9 % . Once depleted , the aquifer will take over 6,000 years to replenish naturally through rainfall .",

In the description in the Book of Exodus , manna is described as being `` a fine , flake - like thing '' like the frost on the ground . It is described in the Book of Numbers as arriving with the dew during the night . Exodus adds that manna was comparable to hoarfrost in color , similarly had to be collected before it was melted by the heat of the sun , and was like a coriander seed in size but white in color . Numbers describes it as having the appearance of bdellium , adding that the Israelites ground it and pounded it into cakes , which were then baked , resulting in something that tasted like cakes baked with oil . Exodus states that raw manna tasted like wafers that had been made with honey . The Israelites were instructed to eat only the manna they had gathered for each day . Stored manna `` bred worms and stank '' : the exception being that stored the day before the Sabbath ( Preparation Day ) , when twice the amount of manna was gathered . This manna did not spoil overnight , because , Exodus 16 : 23 -- 24 states : This is what the Lord commanded : `` Tomorrow is to be a day of rest , a holy Sabbath to the Lord . So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil . Save whatever is left and keep it until morning . '' So they saved it until morning , as Moses commanded , and it did not stink or get maggots in it .",

    "question": "who wrote the music to the sound of music",
    "context": "The Sound of Music is a 1965 American musical drama film produced and directed by Robert Wise , and starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer , with Richard Haydn and Eleanor Parker . The film is an adaptation of the 1959 stage musical of the same name , composed by Richard Rodgers with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II . The film 's screenplay was written by Ernest Lehman , adapted from the stage musical 's book by Lindsay and Crouse .

After bringing and teaching love and music into the lives of the family through kindness and patience , she marries the officer and together with the children they find a way to survive the loss of their homeland through courage and faith . The film was released on March 2 , 1965 in the United States , initially as a limited roadshow theatrical release . Although critical response to the film was widely mixed , the film was a major commercial success , becoming the number one box office movie after four weeks , and the highest - grossing film of 1965 . By November 1966 , The Sound of Music had become the highest - grossing film of all - time -- surpassing Gone with the Wind -- and held that distinction for five years . The film was just as popular throughout the world , breaking previous box - office records in twenty - nine countries . Following an initial theatrical release that lasted four and a half years , and two successful re-releases , the film sold 283 million admissions worldwide and earned a total worldwide gross of $286,000,000 .",

    "question": "when did the early middle ages start and end",
    "context": "The Early Middle Ages or Early Medieval Period , typically regarded as lasting from the 6th century to the 10th century CE , marked the start of the Middle Ages of European history . The Early Middle Ages followed the decline of the Western Roman Empire and preceded the High Middle Ages ( c. 10th to 13th centuries ) . The Early Middle Ages overlap with Late Antiquity . The term `` Late Antiquity '' is used to emphasize elements of continuity with the Roman Empire , while `` Early Middle Ages '' is used to emphasize developments characteristic of the later medieval period . The period saw a continuation of trends begun during late classical antiquity , including population decline , especially in urban centres , a decline of trade , and increased immigration . The period has been labelled the `` Dark Ages '' , a characterization highlighting the relative scarcity of literary and cultural output from this time , especially in Northwestern Europe . The term `` Dark Ages '' is inappropriate when applied to the Iberian peninsula , since during the Caliphate of Córdoba and Taifas periods Spanish culture , learning , arts , and science flourished as nowhere else in Europe , and Córdoba was the largest city in the world . However , the Eastern Roman Empire , or Byzantine Empire , continued to survive , though in the 7th century the Islamic caliphates conquered swathes of formerly Roman territory .",

    "context": "Gumball Tristopher Watterson ( voiced by Logan Grove , seasons 1 -- 2 and season 3 episode : `` The Kids '' ; Jacob Hopkins , rest of seasons 3 - 4 and season 5 episodes : `` The Rerun '' - `` The Copycats '' and `` The Fuss '' ; Nicolas Cantu , rest of seasons 5 onward ) is a 12 - year - old mostly mischievous light blue cat who lives with his family in the fictional California city of Elmore . He attends Elmore Junior High in the seventh grade with his brother Darwin , who is 10 years old . Often finding himself and Darwin in various antics which end up getting them into trouble , episodes in the series ' first season characterized Gumball as well - meaning in his actions , but with naive tendencies ; throughout the show 's progression , he has since established himself as a more serious character capable of logical thinking and prone to sarcasm . Despite his rambunctious behavior and occasional lapses in judgement , he is ultimately a loyal , straightforward , and kindhearted person at heart . A recurring theme throughout the series is his crush on his classmate Penny Fitzgerald , who in turn shares the same feelings for him . They initially struggle to properly express their feelings for each other until the episode `` The Shell '' , where he finally works up the nerve to express his feelings to her after she reveals her true form , and they begin dating . In the premiere of season 3 it is revealed that Gumball and Darwin are part of a small fraction of people who do n't age past a certain point , which by the end of the episode causes them to regress to a point slightly before puberty . His middle name was supposed to be Christopher , but Richard confused it for Tristopher and it stuck . Gumball is a very imaginative person . Despite his mediocre academic performance , he can be surprisingly brilliant when it comes to formulating all sorts of mischievous schemes . This side of him can be seen in episodes such as `` The Plan , '' in which he quickly formulates a basic outline to he and his siblings plan to `` save '' their mother , and in `` The Scam , '' in which he forms a crafty scheme that will allow him to cleanly heist the town 's candy effortlessly . Such a side may also suggest Gumball is smarter than he lets on , as hinted by his expansive vocabulary , cooking skills , and ukulele skills as well .",

    "context": "The origins of the name are unclear . Possibilities include being a new river that was not on the Fry - Jefferson map of Virginia , an Indian name meaning `` new waters '' , or the surname of an early settler . Despite its name , the New River is one of the five oldest rivers in the world geologically . This ancient river begins in the mountains of North Carolina near the Tennessee state line , flows generally northeastward across the Blue Ridge Mountains , Great Appalachian Valley , Ridge and Valley Province , and the Allegheny Front in western North Carolina and Virginia , before turning and following a more northwestward course into West Virginia , where it then cuts through the Appalachian Plateau ( in the New River Gorge ) to meet the Gauley River and become the Kanawha River in south - central West Virginia . The Kanawha then flows into the Ohio River at Point Pleasant , West Virginia . Much of the river 's course is lined with steep cliffs and rock outcrops , particularly in its gorge in West Virginia . This low - level crossing of the Appalachians , many millions of years old , has long been a biogeographical corridor allowing numerous species of plants and animals to spread between the lowlands of the American East Coast and those of the Midwest ; other unusual kinds of plants occur on the gorge 's cliffs or rim - top ledges . Portions of this corridor are now also used by various railroads and highways , and some segments of the river have been dammed for hydroelectric power production .",

    "question": "what is the reason for irradiating food with gamma rays",
    "context": "Food irradiation is the process of exposing food and food packaging to ionizing radiation . Ionizing radiation , such from gamma rays , x-rays or electron beams , is energy that can be transmitted without direct contact to the source of the energy ( radiation ) capable of freeing electrons from their atomic bonds ( ionization ) in the targeted food . The radiation can be emitted by a radioactive substance or generated electrically . This treatment is used to improve food safety by extending product shelf - life ( preservation ) , reducing the risk of foodborne illness , delaying or eliminating sprouting or ripening , by sterilization of foods , and as a means of controlling insects and invasive pests . Food irradiation primarily extends the shelf - life of irradiated foods by effectively destroying organisms responsible for spoilage and foodborne illness and inhibiting sprouting . Although consumer perception of foods treated with irradiation is more negative than those processed by other means , because people imagine that the food is radioactive or mutated , all independent research , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , and U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) have confirmed irradiation to be safe . Food irradiation is permitted by over 60 countries , with about 500,000 metric tons of food annually processed worldwide . The regulations that dictate how food is to be irradiated , as well as the food allowed to be irradiated , vary greatly from country to country . In Austria , Germany , and many other countries of the European Union only dried herbs , spices , and seasonings can be processed with irradiation and only at a specific dose , while in Brazil all foods are allowed at any dose .",

Among them are the Khojak Pass , about eighty kilometres northwest of Quetta in Balochistan ; the Khyber Pass , forty kilometres west of Peshawar and leading to Kabul ; and the Broghol Pass in the far north , providing access to the Wakhan Corridor . Less than one - fifth of Pakistan 's land area has the potential for intensive agricultural use . Nearly all of the arable land is actively cultivated , but outputs are low by world standards . Cultivation is sparse in the northern mountains , the southern deserts , and the western plateaus , but the Indus River basin in Punjab and northern Sindh has fertile soil that enables Pakistan to feed its population under usual climatic conditions . The name Indus comes from the Sanskrit word sindhu , meaning ocean , from which also come the words Sindh , Hindu , and India . The Indus , one of the great rivers of the world , rises in southwestern Tibet only about 160 kilometres west of the source of the Sutlej River , which first flows through Punjab , India and joins the Indus in Pakistani Punjab , and the Brahmaputra , which runs eastward before turning southwest and flowing through India and , Bangladesh . The catchment area of the Indus is estimated at almost 1 million square kilometres , and all of Pakistan 's major rivers -- the Kabul , Jhelum and , Chenab -- flow into it .

'' After the events in chapters 32 and 33 , the LORD told Moses , `` Hew thee two tablets of stone like unto the first : and I will write upon these tablets the words that were in the first tablets , which thou brakest . '' `` And he wrote on the tablets , according to the first writing , the ten commandments , which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly : and the LORD gave them unto me .

    "question": "mention two problems that forced india to undertake new economic policy after 1991",
    "context": "Indian economic policy after independence was influenced by the colonial experience ( which was seen by Indian leaders as exploitative in nature ) and by those leaders ' exposure to Fabian socialism . Policy tended towards protectionism , with a strong emphasis on import substitution , industrialisation under state monitoring , state intervention at the micro level in all businesses especially in labour and financial markets , a large public sector , business regulation , and central planning . Five - Year Plans of India resembled central planning in the Soviet Union . Steel , mining , machine tools , water , telecommunications , insurance , and electrical plants , among other industries , were effectively nationalised in the mid-1950s . Elaborate licences , regulations and the accompanying red tape , commonly referred to as Licence Raj , were required to set up business in India between 1947 and 1990 . Before the process of reform began in 1991 , the government attempted to close the Indian economy to the outside world . The Indian currency , the rupee , was inconvertible and high tariffs and import licensing prevented foreign goods reaching the market . India also operated a system of central planning for the economy , in which firms required licences to invest and develop . The labyrinthine bureaucracy often led to absurd restrictions -- up to 80 agencies had to be satisfied before a firm could be granted a licence to produce and the state would decide what was produced , how much , at what price and what sources of capital were used . The government also prevented firms from laying off workers or closing factories . The central pillar of the policy was import substitution , the belief that India needed to rely on internal markets for development , not international trade -- a belief generated by a mixture of socialism and the experience of colonial exploitation . Planning and the state , rather than markets , would determine how much investment was needed in which sectors . Attempts were made to liberalise the economy in 1966 and 1985 . The first attempt was reversed in 1967 . Thereafter , a stronger version of socialism was adopted . The second major attempt was in 1985 by prime minister Rajiv Gandhi . The process came to a halt in 1987 , though 1967 style reversal did not take place .",

    "question": "ragtime is a blend of what two musical styles",
    "context": "Ragtime -- also spelled rag - time or rag time -- is a musical style that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918 . Its cardinal trait is its syncopated , or `` ragged '' , rhythm . The style has its origins in African - American communities in cities such as St. Louis . Ernest Hogan ( 1865 -- 1909 ) was a pioneer of ragtime and was the first composer to have his ragtime pieces ( or `` rags '' ) published as sheet music , beginning with the song `` La Pas Ma La '' , published in 1895 . Hogan has also been credited for coining the term ragtime . The term is actually derived from his hometown `` Shake Rag '' in Bowling Green , Kentucky . Ben Harney , another Kentucky native , has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public . His first ragtime composition , `` You 've Been a Good Old Wagon But You Done Broke Down '' , helped popularize the style . The composition was published in 1896 , a few months after Ernest Hogan 's `` La Pas Ma La . '' Ragtime was also a modification of the march style popularized by John Philip Sousa , with additional polyrhythms coming from African music . Ragtime composer Scott Joplin ( ca . 1868 -- 1917 ) became famous through the publication of the `` Maple Leaf Rag '' ( 1899 ) and a string of ragtime hits such as `` The Entertainer '' ( 1902 ) , although he was later forgotten by all but a small , dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s . For at least 12 years after its publication , `` Maple Leaf Rag '' heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines , harmonic progressions or metric patterns . Ragtime fell out of favor as jazz claimed the public 's imagination after 1917 , but there have been numerous revivals since the music has been re-discovered . First in the early 1940s , many jazz bands began to include ragtime in their repertoire and put out ragtime recordings on 78 rpm records . A more significant revival occurred in the 1950s as a wider variety of ragtime genres of the past were made available on records , and new rags were composed , published , and recorded . In 1971 Joshua Rifkin brought out a compilation of Joplin 's work which was nominated for a Grammy Award . In 1973 The New England Ragtime Ensemble ( then a student group called The New England Conservatory Ragtime Ensemble ) recorded The Red Back Book , a compilation of some of Joplin 's rags in period orchestrations edited by conservatory president Gunther Schuller . This also won a Grammy for Best Chamber Music Performance of the year and was named Billboard 's Top Classical Album of 1974 . Subsequently , the motion picture The Sting ( 1973 ) brought ragtime to a wide audience with its soundtrack of Joplin tunes . The film 's rendering of `` The Entertainer '' , adapted and orchestrated by Marvin Hamlisch , was a Top 5 hit in 1975 .",

    "context": "The House of Representatives , by comparison , is required by Article I , Section 2 , to be `` apportioned among the several states ... according to their respective numbers . '' The Constitution does not provide for either fractional votes nor Congressional seats spanning states , and guarantees every state at least one Representative . Thus , a resident of a state whose population just barely qualifies for two Representatives has almost twice the relative influence as a resident of a state that does not quite qualify for two . 2 U.S.C. § 2a , based on the Reapportionment Act of 1929 , reapportions the Representatives to the states following each decennial census . It left the states to decide how and whether to redistrict , except in the case that the census changes the state 's number of Representatives , but federal court cases now require states to redistrict based on each census . However , here too , other criteria take precedence over exact equality of representation . In 2012 , the Supreme Court endorsed Tennant v. Jefferson County the use of other criteria , including the legislature 's reluctance to move voters between districts , to put incumbent Congressmen in the same district , and to divide counties between districts , when the State of West Virginia redrew its three Congressional districts with a disparity of 0.79 % between the most populous and least populous district .",

    "context": "In 1849 , the California Gold Rush attracted 100,000 would - be miners from the Eastern U.S. , Latin America , China , Australia , and Europe . California became a state in 1850 with a population of about 90,000 . Between 1850 and 1930 , about 5 million Germans migrated to the United States , peaking between 1881 and 1885 when a million Germans settled primarily in the Midwest . Between 1820 and 1930 , 3.5 million British and 4.5 million Irish entered America . Before 1845 most Irish immigrants were Protestants . After 1845 , Irish Catholics began arriving in large numbers , largely driven by the Great Famine . After 1880 larger steam - powered oceangoing ships replaced sailing ships , which resulted in lower fares and greater immigrant mobility . Meanwhile , farming improvements in Southern Europe and the Russian Empire created surplus labor . Young people between the ages of 15 to 30 were predominant among newcomers . This wave of migration , constituting the third episode in the history of U.S. immigration , may be better referred to as a flood of immigrants , as nearly 25 million Europeans made the long trip . Italians , Greeks , Hungarians , Poles , and others speaking Slavic languages made up the bulk of this migration. 2.5 to 4 million Jews were among them .",

    "question": "what are the three estates in french society",
    "context": "The estates of the realm , or three estates , were the broad orders of social hierarchy used in Christendom ( Christian Europe ) from the medieval period to early modern Europe . Different systems for dividing society members into estates developed and evolved over time . The best known system is the French Ancien Régime ( Old Regime ) , a three - estate system used until the French Revolution ( 1789 -- 1799 ) . Monarchy was for the king and the queen and this system was made up of clergy ( the First Estate ) , nobles ( the Second Estate ) , and peasants and bourgeoisie ( the Third Estate ) . In some regions , notably Scandinavia and Russia , burghers ( the urban merchant class ) and rural commoners were split into separate estates , creating a four - estate system with rural commoners ranking the lowest as the Fourth Estate . Furthermore , the non-landowning poor could be left outside the estates , leaving them without political rights . In England , a two - estate system evolved that combined nobility and bishops into one lordly estate with `` commons '' as the second estate . This system produced the two houses of parliament , the House of Commons and the House of Lords . In southern Germany , a three - estate system of nobility ( princes and high clergy ) , ritters ( knights ) , and burghers was used . Today the terms three estates and estates of the realm may sometimes be re-interpreted to refer to the modern separation of powers in government into the legislature , administration , and the judiciary . Additionally the term fourth estate usually refers to forces outside the established power structure ( evoking medieval three - estate systems ) , most commonly in reference to the independent press or media . Historically , in Northern and Eastern Europe , the Fourth Estate meant rural commoners .",

    "question": "who wrote best day of my life lyrics",
    "context": "`` Best Day of My Life '' is a song by American indie rock band American Authors . The song was written by band members Zac Barnett , Dave Rublin , Matt Sanchez , and James Adam Shelley , along with producers Aaron Accetta and Shep Goodman . `` Best Day of My Life '' was originally recorded for release as a single by Mercury Records and Island Records on March 19 , 2013 , and later appeared as the second track on the band 's third extended play , American Authors ( 2013 ) , and the third track on their debut studio album , Oh , What a Life ( 2014 ) . Zac Barnett told an interviewer for Blueprint Magazine , `` Recently we have been experimenting with a lot of different instruments including banjo , mandolin and various percussion toys . Africa - influenced rhythms have been taking more of a prominent role in our songs which has then opened up our ideas on melodies . We 're always open to trying new things and we get very excited to learn new instruments and experiment with new sounds ... `` Best Day of My Life '' was an idea that James and I had been messing around with . We had the pre-chorus and chorus but once we showed the idea to the rest of the guys they came in and restructured the verses and added the stuttered `` life '' chorus . Looking back on it , the song changed a lot from the initial idea but that 's what I love so much about it . I 'll always remember that song being started on acoustic guitars in my tiny Bushwick bedroom , but all of us together as a band really took the song to a completely different place . ''",

    "context": "The San , or Bushmen , are indigenous people in Southern Africa particularly in what is now South Africa and Botswana . Their ancient rock paintings and carvings ( collectively called rock art ) are found in caves and on rock shelters . The artwork depicts non-human beings , hunters , and half - human half - animal hybrids . The half - human hybrids are believed to be medicine men or healers involved in a healing dance . '' Gall writes , `` The Laurens van der Post panel at Tsodilo is one of the most famous rock paintings . '' High on this rock face in Botswana is the image of a `` magnificent red eland bull '' painted , according to Van der Post , `` only as a Bushman who had a deep identification with the eland could have painted him . '' Also on this rock face is a female giraffe that is motionless , as if alarmed by a predator . Several other images of animals are depicted there too , along with the flesh blood - red handprints that are the signature of the unknown artist . The Drakensberg and Lesotho is particularly well known for its San rock art . Tsodilo was recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001 ; not all the art covered by this is by San people or their ancestors .",

    "question": "what are the main industries driving the economy of the bahamas",
    "context": "The Bahamas is a stable , developing nation with an economy heavily dependent on tourism and offshore banking . Steady growth in tourism receipts and a boom in construction of new hotels , resorts , and residences had led to solid GDP growth for many years , but the slowdown in the US economy and the attacks of September 11 , 2001 held back growth in these sectors in 2001 - 03 . Financial services constitute the second-most important sector of the Bahamian economy , accounting for about 15 % of GDP . However , since December 2000 , when the government enacted new regulations on the financial sector , many international businesses have left The Bahamas . Manufacturing and agriculture together contribute approximately a tenth of GDP and show little growth , despite government incentives aimed at those sectors . Overall growth prospects in the short run rest heavily on the fortunes of the tourism sector , which depends on growth in the US , the source of more than 80 % of the visitors . In addition to tourism and banking , the government supports the development of a `` 2nd - pillar '' , e-commerce . The Bahamian economy is almost entirely dependent on tourism and financial services to generate foreign exchange earnings . Tourism alone provides an estimated 45 % of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) and employs about half the Bahamian workforce . In 2016 , over 3 million tourists visited The Bahamas , most of whom are from the United States and Canada .",

    "context": "World 's fairs originated in the French tradition of national exhibitions , a tradition that culminated with the French Industrial Exposition of 1844 held in Paris . This fair was followed by other national exhibitions in continental Europe and the United Kingdom . The best - known ' first World Expo ' was held in The Crystal Palace in Hyde Park , London , United Kingdom , in 1851 , under the title `` Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations '' . The Great Exhibition , as it is often called , was an idea of Prince Albert , Queen Victoria 's husband , and is usually considered to be the first international exhibition of manufactured products . It influenced the development of several aspects of society , including art - and - design education , international trade and relations , and tourism . These events have resulted in a remarkable form of Prince Albert 's life history , one that continues to be reflected in London architecture in a number of ways , including in the Albert Memorial later erected to the Prince . This expo was the most obvious precedent for the many international exhibitions , later called world 's fairs , that have continued to be held to the present time . Since their inception in 1851 , the character of world expositions has evolved . Three eras can be distinguished : the era of industrialization , the era of cultural exchange , and the era of nation branding .",

Campbell clarified in December 2017 that Lionsgate and Millennium Films had lost the franchise rights due to the time it took to release it . Several comic books based on The Texas Chainsaw Massacre films were published in 1991 by Northstar Comics entitled Leatherface . They were licensed as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre to Avatar Press for use in new comic book stories , the first of which was published in 2005 . In 2006 , Avatar Press lost the license to DC Comics imprint , Wildstorm , which has published new stories based on the films .

    "question": "who won most super bowls in a row",
    "context": "Before the 1970 merger between the American Football League ( AFL ) and the National Football League ( NFL ) , the two leagues met in four such contests . The first two were marketed as the `` AFL -- NFL World Championship Game '' , but were also casually referred to as `` the Super Bowl game '' during the television broadcast . Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the `` Super Bowl '' moniker in official marketing ; the names `` Super Bowl I '' and `` Super Bowl II '' were retroactively applied to the first two games . The NFC / NFL leads in Super Bowl wins with 27 , while the AFC / AFL has won 25 . Twenty franchises , including teams that have relocated to another city , have won the Super Bowl . The Pittsburgh Steelers ( 6 -- 2 ) have won the most Super Bowls with six championships , while the New England Patriots ( 5 -- 5 ) , the Dallas Cowboys ( 5 -- 3 ) , and the San Francisco 49ers ( 5 -- 1 ) have five wins . New England has the most Super Bowl appearances with ten , while the Buffalo Bills ( 0 -- 4 ) have the most consecutive appearances with four ( all losses ) from 1990 to 1993 . The Miami Dolphins are the only other team to have at least three consecutive appearances : 1972 -- 1974 . The Denver Broncos ( 3 -- 5 ) and Patriots have each lost a record five Super Bowls . The Minnesota Vikings ( 0 -- 4 ) and the Bills have lost four . The record for consecutive wins is two and is shared by seven franchises : the Green Bay Packers ( 1966 -- 1967 ) , the Miami Dolphins ( 1972 -- 1973 ) , the Pittsburgh Steelers ( 1974 -- 1975 and 1978 -- 1979 , the only team to accomplish this feat twice ) , the San Francisco 49ers ( 1988 -- 1989 ) , the Dallas Cowboys ( 1992 -- 1993 ) , the Denver Broncos ( 1997 -- 1998 ) , and the New England Patriots ( 2003 -- 2004 ) . Among those , Dallas ( 1992 -- 1993 ; 1995 ) and New England ( 2001 ; 2003 -- 2004 ) are the only teams to win three out of four consecutive Super Bowls . The 1972 Dolphins capped off the only perfect season in NFL history with their victory in Super Bowl VII . The only team with multiple Super Bowl appearances and no losses is the Baltimore Ravens , who in winning Super Bowl XLVII defeated and replaced the 49ers in that position . Four current NFL teams have never appeared in a Super Bowl , including franchise relocations and renaming : the Cleveland Browns , Detroit Lions , Jacksonville Jaguars , and Houston Texans , though both the Browns ( 1964 ) and Lions ( 1957 ) had won NFL championship games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl .

    "question": "where was james bond for your eyes only filmed",
    "context": "The screenplay by Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson takes its characters and combines elements from the plots from two short stories from Ian Fleming 's For Your Eyes Only collection : the title story and `` Risico '' . In the plot , Bond attempts to locate a missile command system while becoming tangled in a web of deception spun by rival Greek businessmen along with Melina Havelock , a woman seeking to avenge the murder of her parents . Some writing elements were inspired by the novels Live and Let Die , Goldfinger and On Her Majesty 's Secret Service . After the science fiction - focused Moonraker , the producers wanted a conscious return to the style of the early Bond films and the works of 007 creator Fleming . For Your Eyes Only followed a grittier , more realistic approach and a narrative theme of revenge and its consequences . Filming locations included Greece , Italy and England , while underwater footage was shot in The Bahamas . For Your Eyes Only was released on 24 June 1981 , ten years after release of Diamonds Are Forever ( 1971 ) , to a mixed critical reception ; the film was a financial success , generating $195.3 million worldwide . This was the final Bond film to be distributed solely by United Artists ; the studio merged with Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer soon after this film 's release .",

    "question": "where are most peanuts grown in the us",
    "context": "After the peanuts have dried sufficiently , they are threshed , removing the peanut pods from the rest of the bush . It is particularly important that peanuts are dried properly and stored in dry conditions . If they are too high in moisture , or if storage conditions are poor , they may become infected by the mold fungus Aspergillus flavus . Many strains of this fungus release toxic and highly carcinogenic substances called aflatoxins . There are many peanut cultivars grown around the world . The market classes grown in the United States are Spanish , Runner , Virginia , and Valencia . Peanuts produced in the United States are divided into three major areas : the southeastern United States region which includes Alabama , Georgia , and Florida ; the southwestern United States region which includes New Mexico , Oklahoma , and Texas ; and the third region in the general eastern United States which include Virginia , North Carolina , and South Carolina . Certain cultivar groups are preferred for particular characteristics , such as differences in flavor , oil content , size , shape , and disease resistance . Most peanuts marketed in the shell are of the Virginia type , along with some Valencias selected for large size and the attractive appearance of the shell . Spanish peanuts are used mostly for peanut candy , salted nuts , and peanut butter .",

    "context": "The Cape of Good Hope , also known as the Cape Colony ( Dutch : Kaapkolonie ) , was a British colony in present - day South Africa , named after the Cape of Good Hope . The British colony was preceded by an earlier Dutch colony of the same name , the Kaap de Goede Hoop , established in 1652 by the Dutch East India Company . The Cape was under Dutch rule from 1652 to 1795 and again from 1803 to 1806 . The Dutch lost the colony to Great Britain following the 1795 Battle of Muizenberg , but had it returned following the 1802 Peace of Amiens . It was re-occupied by the UK following the Battle of Blaauwberg in 1806 , and British possession affirmed with the Anglo - Dutch Treaty of 1814 . The Cape of Good Hope then remained in the British Empire , becoming self - governing in 1872 , and uniting with three other colonies to form the Union of South Africa in 1910 . It then was renamed the Province of the Cape of Good Hope . South Africa became a sovereign state in 1931 by the Statute of Westminster . In 1961 it became the Republic of South Africa and obtained its own monetary unit called the Rand . Following the 1994 creation of the present - day South African provinces , the Cape Province was partitioned into the Eastern Cape , Northern Cape , and Western Cape , with smaller parts in North West province .",

    "context": "Bamboo cutting boards are an alternative to plastic or glass cutting boards , partially because Bamboo is commonly thought to be naturally antimicrobial ( although studies show otherwise ) . During the harvesting process , bamboo is carefully chosen for maturation , markings , and size . The stalk is then cut into specific sizes and sent through a pressing process that strips the stalks into smaller plank - like pieces . Once the bamboo is pliable , a cutting board can be produced from multiple pieces by lamination . Plastic boards are usually called PE ( polyethylene ) cutting boards , or HDPE ( high - density polyethylene plastic ) , the material of which these boards are made . There are basically two types of HDPE boards being made . One version is made from injection - molded plastic , while the other is HDPE from an extrusion line . There are several certifications of plastic cutting boards , one being NSF , that certifies the plastic has passed requirements to come in contact with food . Unlike wood , plastic has no inherent antiseptic properties . However , unlike wood , plastic boards do allow rinsing with harsher cleaning chemicals such as bleach and other disinfectants without damage to the board or retention of the chemicals to later contaminate food .",

    "context": "The rising popularity of ADR can be explained by the increasing caseload of traditional courts , the perception that ADR imposes fewer costs than litigation , a preference for confidentiality , and the desire of some parties to have greater control over the selection of the individual or individuals who will decide their dispute . Some of the senior judiciary in certain jurisdictions ( of which England and Wales is one ) are strongly in favour of this ( ADR ) use of mediation to settle disputes . Alternative dispute resolution ( ADR ) is generally classified into at least four types : negotiation , mediation , collaborative law , and arbitration . Sometimes , conciliation is included as a fifth category , but for simplicity may be regarded as a form of mediation . ADR can be used alongside existing legal systems such as Sharia courts within common law jurisdictions , such as the UK . ADR traditions vary somewhat by country and culture . There are significant common elements which justify a main topic , and each country or region 's difference should be delegated to sub-pages .",

The Olympic Games are considered the world 's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating . The Olympic Games are held every four years , with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart . Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games , which were held in Olympia , Greece , from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD . Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) in 1894 , leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896 . The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement , with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority . The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games . Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports , the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability , the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes , and the five Continental games ( Pan American , African , Asian , European , and Pacific ) .

The sonic screwdriver was first introduced in 1968 in the story Fury from the Deep , and used twice more ( The Dominators and The War Games ) during the Second Doctor 's tenure . It became a popular tool for the Third Doctor and Fourth Doctor . It was finally written out of the series in 1982 due to the limitations it caused when writing for the show . It then featured briefly in the 1996 Doctor Who television movie , before making a full return in the 2005 continuation of the series . Throughout the programme , there have been many different versions of the sonic screwdriver , as with subsequent Doctors the design of it was changed . It has also been destroyed on a number of occasions , thus leading to the introduction of the next model . Not all iterations of the Doctor have used the sonic screwdriver on screen ; the Fifth Doctor in fact opted not to replace his after it was destroyed .",

    "context": "`` You 've Made Me So Very Happy '' is a song written by Brenda Holloway , Patrice Holloway , Frank Wilson and Berry Gordy , and was released first as a single in 1967 by Brenda Holloway on the Tamla label . The song was later a huge hit for jazz - rock band Blood , Sweat & Tears in 1969 , and became a Gold record . By 1967 , Brenda Holloway had been recording for Motown Records since 1964 and had struggled with Berry Gordy over control of her music , alleging that Gordy had forced her to sing Mary Wells ' `` leftover tracks '' after the Motown singer left the label in 1964 . Some of the songs in question included modest hits such as `` When I 'm Gone '' and `` Operator '' . Holloway was planning to release her long - awaited second album , Hurtin ' & Cryin , which had released `` Just Look What You 've Done '' as the leading track , but for unknown reasons the record was shelved . Along with her sister Patrice , using music provided by Frank Wilson and with additional help from Gordy himself , Holloway co-wrote `` You 've Made Me So Very Happy '' . Coincidentally , Holloway recorded the song after a breakup with a boyfriend .",

    "question": "what was the goals of the new deal",
    "context": "The New Deal was a series of programs , public work projects , financial reforms and regulations enacted in the United States 1933 - 36 , in response to the Great Depression . Some of these federal programs included the Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) , the Civil Works Administration ( CWA ) , the Farm Security Administration ( FSA ) , the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 ( NIRA ) and the Social Security Administration ( SSA ) . These programs included support for farmers , the unemployed , youth and the elderly . It included new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and efforts to re-inflate the economy after prices had fallen sharply . New Deal programs included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt . The programs focused on what historians refer to as the `` 3 Rs '' : relief for the unemployed and poor , recovery of the economy back to normal levels and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression . The New Deal produced a political realignment , making the Democratic Party the majority ( as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 -- 1969 ) with its base in liberal ideas , the South , traditional Democrats , big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions and ethnic minorities . The Republicans were split , with conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as hostile to business and economic growth and liberals in support . The realignment crystallized into the New Deal coalition that dominated presidential elections into the 1960s while the opposing conservative coalition largely controlled Congress in domestic affairs from 1937 -- 1964 . By 1936 , the term `` liberal '' typically was used for supporters of the New Deal and `` conservative '' for its opponents . From 1934 to 1938 , Roosevelt was assisted in his endeavors by a `` pro-spender '' majority in Congress ( drawn from two - party , competitive , non-machine , progressive and left party districts ) . In the 1938 midterm election , Roosevelt and his liberal supporters lost control of Congress to the bipartisan conservative coalition . Many historians distinguish between a First New Deal ( 1933 -- 1934 ) and a Second New Deal ( 1935 -- 1938 ) , with the second one more liberal and more controversial .",

    "question": "where does most star formation take place in the milky way",
    "context": "The Galactic disk is surrounded by a spheroidal halo of old stars and globular clusters , of which 90 % lie within 100,000 light - years ( 30 kpc ) of the Galactic Center . However , a few globular clusters have been found farther , such as PAL 4 and AM1 at more than 200,000 light - years from the Galactic Center . About 40 % of the Milky Way 's clusters are on retrograde orbits , which means they move in the opposite direction from the Milky Way rotation . The globular clusters can follow rosette orbits about the Milky Way , in contrast to the elliptical orbit of a planet around a star . Although the disk contains dust that obscures the view in some wavelengths , the halo component does not . Active star formation takes place in the disk ( especially in the spiral arms , which represent areas of high density ) , but does not take place in the halo , as there is little gas cool enough to collapse into stars . Open clusters are also located primarily in the disk . Discoveries in the early 21st century have added dimension to the knowledge of the Milky Way 's structure . With the discovery that the disk of the Andromeda Galaxy ( M31 ) extends much further than previously thought , the possibility of the disk of the Milky Way extending further is apparent , and this is supported by evidence from the discovery of the Outer Arm extension of the Cygnus Arm and of a similar extension of the Scutum - Centaurus Arm . With the discovery of the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy came the discovery of a ribbon of galactic debris as the polar orbit of the dwarf and its interaction with the Milky Way tears it apart . Similarly , with the discovery of the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy , it was found that a ring of galactic debris from its interaction with the Milky Way encircles the Galactic disk .",

    "context": "`` All the world 's a stage '' is the phrase that begins a monologue from William Shakespeare 's As You Like It , spoken by the melancholy Jaques in Act II Scene VII . The speech compares the world to a stage and life to a play , and catalogues the seven stages of a man 's life , sometimes referred to as the seven ages of man : infant , schoolboy , lover , soldier , justice , Pantalone and old age , facing imminent death . It is one of Shakespeare 's most frequently quoted passages . All the world 's a stage , And all the men and women merely players ; They have their exits and their entrances , And one man in his time plays many parts , His acts being seven ages . At first , the infant , Mewling and puking in the nurse 's arms . Then the whining schoolboy , with his satchel And shining morning face , creeping like snail Unwillingly to school . And then the lover , Sighing like furnace , with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress ' eyebrow . Then a soldier , Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard , Jealous in honor , sudden and quick in quarrel , Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannon 's mouth . And then the justice , In fair round belly with good capon lined , With eyes severe and beard of formal cut , Full of wise saws and modern instances ; And so he plays his part . The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slippered pantaloon , With spectacles on nose and pouch on side ; His youthful hose , well saved , a world too wide For his shrunk shank , and his big manly voice , Turning again toward childish treble , pipes And whistles in his sound . Last scene of all , That ends this strange eventful history , Is second childishness and mere oblivion , Sans teeth , sans eyes , sans taste , sans everything .",

There are three aortic sinuses ( dilations ) in the wall of the aorta just superior to the aortic semilunar valve . Two of these , the left posterior aortic sinus and anterior aortic sinus , give rise to the left and right coronary arteries , respectively . The third sinus , the right posterior aortic sinus , typically does not give rise to a vessel . Coronary vessel branches that remain on the surface of the artery and follow the sulci of the heart are called epicardial coronary arteries . The left coronary artery distributes blood to the left side of the heart , the left atrium and ventricle , and the interventricular septum . The circumflex artery arises from the left coronary artery and follows the coronary sulcus to the left . Eventually , it will fuse with the small branches of the right coronary artery . The larger anterior interventricular artery , also known as the left anterior descending artery ( LAD ) , is the second major branch arising from the left coronary artery . It follows the anterior interventricular sulcus around the pulmonary trunk . Along the way it gives rise to numerous smaller branches that interconnect with the branches of the posterior interventricular artery , forming anastomoses . An anastomosis is an area where vessels unite to form interconnections that normally allow blood to circulate to a region even if there may be partial blockage in another branch . The anastomoses in the heart are very small . Therefore , this ability is somewhat restricted in the heart so a coronary artery blockage often results in myocardial infarction causing death of the cells supplied by the particular vessel . The right coronary artery proceeds along the coronary sulcus and distributes blood to the right atrium , portions of both ventricles , and the heart conduction system . Normally , one or more marginal arteries arise from the right coronary artery inferior to the right atrium . The marginal arteries supply blood to the superficial portions of the right ventricle . On the posterior surface of the heart , the right coronary artery gives rise to the posterior interventricular artery , also known as the posterior descending artery . It runs along the posterior portion of the interventricular sulcus toward the apex of the heart , giving rise to branches that supply the interventricular septum and portions of both ventricles .",

DNA analysis intended to identify a species , rather than an individual , is called DNA barcoding . DNA profiling is a forensic technique in criminal investigations , comparing criminal suspects ' profiles to DNA evidence so as to assess the likelihood of their involvement in the crime . It is also used in parentage testing , to establish immigration eligibility , and in genealogical and medical research . DNA profiling has also been used in the study of animal and plant populations in the fields of zoology , botany , and agriculture .",

    "context": "`` Ca n't Take My Eyes Off You '' is a 1967 single credited to Frankie Valli . The song was among his biggest hits , earning a gold record and reaching No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 for a week , stuck behind `` Windy '' by The Association . It was co-written by producer Bob Crewe and Bob Gaudio , a bandmate of Valli 's in The Four Seasons . It was Valli 's biggest solo hit until he hit # 1 in 1974 with `` My Eyes Adored You '' . `` Ca n't Take My Eyes Off You '' has had hundreds of cover versions , many of which have been on the charts in different countries . The song is a staple of television and film soundtracks , even being featured as part of the plot of some films , such as when the lead characters sing or arrange their own version of the song . Its chorus has also become a popular football chant , with supporters of various teams inserting their club 's name or a popular player 's name into the beat ( for instance , A.S. Roma fans sing `` Francesco Totti , la la , la la la la ! '' ) . The Valli version was also used by NASA as a wake - up song on the STS - 126 space shuttle mission , to celebrate the anniversary of astronaut Christopher Ferguson , one of the mission 's crew members .",

In many cases universities petitioned secular power for privileges and this became a model . Emperor Frederick I in Authentica Habita ( 1158 ) gave the first privileges to students in Bologna . Another step was when Pope Alexander III in 1179 `` forbidding masters of the church schools to take fees for granting the license to teach ( licentia docendi ) , and obliging them to give license to properly qualified teachers '' . Hastings Rashdall considered that the integrity of a university was only preserved in such an internally regulated corporation , which protected the scholars from external intervention . This independently evolving organization was absent in the universities of southern Italy and Spain , which served the bureaucratic needs of monarchs and which Rashdall considered to be their artificial creations . The University of Paris was formally recognized when Pope Gregory IX issued the bull Parens scientiarum ( 1231 ) . This was a revolutionary step : studium generale ( university ) and universitas ( corporation of students or teachers ) existed even before , but after the issuing of the bull , they attained autonomy . `` ( T ) he papal bull of 1233 , which stipulated that anyone admitted to be a teacher in Toulouse had the right to teach everywhere without further examinations ( ius ubique docendi ) , in time , transformed this privilege into the single most important defining characteristic of the university and made it the symbol of its institutional autonomy ... By the year 1292 , even the two oldest universities , Bologna and Paris , felt the need to seek similar bulls from Pope Nicholas IV . ''",

    "context": "Vascular tissue is a complex conducting tissue , formed of more than one cell type , found in vascular plants . The primary components of vascular tissue are the xylem and phloem . These two tissues transport fluid and nutrients internally . There are also two meristems associated with vascular tissue : the vascular cambium and the cork cambium . All the vascular tissues within a particular plant together constitute the vascular tissue system of that plant . The cells in vascular tissue are typically long and slender . Since the xylem and phloem function in the conduction of water , minerals , and nutrients throughout the plant , it is not surprising that their form should be similar to pipes . The individual cells of phloem are connected end - to - end , just as the sections of a pipe might be . As the plant grows , new vascular tissue differentiates in the growing tips of the plant . The new tissue is aligned with existing vascular tissue , maintaining its connection throughout the plant . The vascular tissue in plants is arranged in long , discrete strands called vascular bundles . These bundles include both xylem and phloem , as well as supporting and protective cells . In stems and roots , the xylem typically lies closer to the interior of the stem with phloem towards the exterior of the stem . In the stems of some Asterales dicots , there may be phloem located inwardly from the xylem as well .",

    "question": "who are the native speakers of english language",
    "context": "Through the worldwide influence of the British Empire , modern English spread around the world from the 17th to mid-20th centuries . Through all types of printed and electronic media , as well as the emergence of the United States as a global superpower , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and in professional contexts such as science , navigation and law . English is the third most widespread native language in the world , after Standard Chinese and Spanish . It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states . There are more people who have learned it as a second language than there are native speakers . English is the most commonly spoken language in the United Kingdom , the United States , Canada , Australia , Ireland and New Zealand , and it is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean , Africa and South Asia . It is co-official language of the United Nations , of the European Union and of many other world and regional international organisations . It is the most widely spoken Germanic language , accounting for at least 70 % of speakers of this Indo - European branch . English has a vast vocabulary , and counting exactly how many words it has is impossible . Modern English grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo - European dependent marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order , to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection , a fairly fixed SVO word order and a complex syntax . Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses , aspect and mood , as well as passive constructions , interrogatives and some negation . Despite noticeable variation among the accents and dialects of English used in different countries and regions -- in terms of phonetics and phonology , and sometimes also vocabulary , grammar and spelling -- English - speakers from around the world are able to communicate with one another with relative ease .",

    "question": "the names of the brothers who besieged troy for 10 long years",
    "context": "In Greek mythology , the Trojan War was waged against the city of Troy by the Achaeans ( Greeks ) after Paris of Troy took Helen from her husband Menelaus , king of Sparta . The war is one of the most important events in Greek mythology and has been narrated through many works of Greek literature , most notably Homer 's Iliad . The core of the Iliad ( Books II -- XXIII ) describes a period of four days and two nights in the tenth year of the decade - long siege of Troy ; the Odyssey describes the journey home of Odysseus , one of the war 's heroes . Other parts of the war are described in a cycle of epic poems , which have survived through fragments . Episodes from the war provided material for Greek tragedy and other works of Greek literature , and for Roman poets including Virgil and Ovid . The war originated from a quarrel between the goddesses Hera , Athena , and Aphrodite , after Eris , the goddess of strife and discord , gave them a golden apple , sometimes known as the Apple of Discord , marked `` for the fairest '' . Zeus sent the goddesses to Paris , who judged that Aphrodite , as the `` fairest '' , should receive the apple . In exchange , Aphrodite made Helen , the most beautiful of all women and wife of Menelaus , fall in love with Paris , who took her to Troy . Agamemnon , king of Mycenae and the brother of Helen 's husband Menelaus , led an expedition of Achaean troops to Troy and besieged the city for ten years because of Paris ' insult . After the deaths of many heroes , including the Achaeans Achilles and Ajax , and the Trojans Hector and Paris , the city fell to the ruse of the Trojan Horse . The Achaeans slaughtered the Trojans ( except for some of the women and children whom they kept or sold as slaves ) and desecrated the temples , thus earning the gods ' wrath . Few of the Achaeans returned safely to their homes and many founded colonies in distant shores . The Romans later traced their origin to Aeneas , Aphrodite 's son and one of the Trojans , who was said to have led the surviving Trojans to modern - day Italy . The ancient Greeks believed that Troy was located near the Dardanelles and that the Trojan War was a historical event of the 13th or 12th century BC , but by the mid-19th century , both the war and the city were widely seen as non-historical . In 1868 , however , the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann met Frank Calvert , who convinced Schliemann that Troy was a real city at what is now Hissarlik in Turkey . On the basis of excavations conducted by Schliemann and others , this claim is now accepted by most scholars .",

The studios announced production on the sequel following the first film 's strong performance in Thursday late - night screenings , where it grossed $4.9 million . They acquired film rights to the Allegiant novel in December 2013 , deciding in April 2014 to split the third novel into a two - part film adaptation . The first installment , Divergent ( 2014 ) , grossed over $288 million worldwide , while the second installment , The Divergent Series : Insurgent ( 2015 ) , grossed over $297 million worldwide . Insurgent was also the first Divergent film to be released in IMAX 3D . The third installment , The Divergent Series : Allegiant ( 2016 ) , grossed $179 million . The first three films of the series have grossed over $765 million worldwide . In March 2011 , Summit Entertainment picked up the rights for Divergent with Douglas Wick and Lucy Fisher 's production company Red Wagon Entertainment , while Lionsgate distributes the franchise . Neil Burger was announced as the director on August 23 , 2012 . Evan Daugherty , who co-wrote the screenplay with Vanessa Taylor , said , `` I get hung up on the toughness of the movie but of equal importance is the love story between Tris and Four . It 's inherently and inextricably linked to Tris ' character journey . There will be plenty of sexual tension and chemistry , but it 's important that all of that stuff does n't just feel like it 's thrown in , but that it all helps Tris grow as a character . '' Daugherty further added , `` It 's tricky because the book is a very packed read with a lot of big ideas . So , distilling that into a cool , faithful two - hour movie is challenging . Not only do you have to establish five factions , but you have to acknowledge that there 's a sixth entity , which is the divergent , and you also have the factionless . So there 's a world that really has to be built out for the big screen ... the movie is going to do it a little more efficiently . '' Author Veronica Roth said about the script of the film : `` Reading a script is a really interesting experience . I 'd never read a script before . I was really impressed by how closely it stuck to the general plot line of the book . ''",

    "context": "A power station , also referred to as a power plant or powerhouse and sometimes generating station or generating plant , is an industrial facility for the generation of electric power . Most power stations contain one or more generators , a rotating machine that converts mechanical power into electrical power . The relative motion between a magnetic field and a conductor creates an electrical current . The energy source harnessed to turn the generator varies widely . Most power stations in the world burn fossil fuels such as coal , oil , and natural gas to generate electricity . Others use nuclear power , but there is an increasing use of cleaner renewable sources such as solar , wind , wave and hydroelectric . In 1870 a hydro electric power station was designed and built by Lord Armstrong at Cragside , England . It used water from lakes on his estate to power Siemens dynamos . The electricity supplied power to lights , heating , produced hot water , ran an elevator as well as labor - saving devices and farm buildings .",

    "context": "The Entente Cordiale ( French pronunciation : ​ ( ɑ̃tɑ̃t kɔʁdjal ) ) was a series of agreements signed on 8 April 1904 between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the French Third Republic which saw a significant improvement in Anglo - French relations . Beyond the immediate concerns of colonial expansion addressed by the agreement , the signing of the Entente Cordiale marked the end of almost a thousand years of intermittent conflict between the two states and their predecessors , and replaced the modus vivendi that had existed since the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 with a more formal agreement . The Entente Cordiale was the culmination of the policy of Théophile Delcassé , France 's foreign minister from 1898 , who believed that a Franco - British understanding would give France some security against any German system of alliances in Western Europe . Credit for the success of the negotiation belongs chiefly to Paul Cambon , France 's ambassador in London , and to the British foreign secretary Lord Lansdowne . The most important feature of the agreement was that it granted freedom of action to the UK in Egypt and to France in Morocco ( with the proviso that France 's eventual dispositions for Morocco include reasonable allowance for Spain 's interests there ) . At the same time , the UK ceded the Los Islands ( off French Guinea ) to France , defined the frontier of Nigeria in France 's favour , and agreed to French control of the upper Gambia valley , while France renounced its exclusive right to certain fisheries off Newfoundland . Furthermore , French and British zones of influence in the not to be colonialized Siam ( Thailand ) were outlined , with the eastern territories , adjacent to French Indochina , becoming a French zone , and the western , adjacent to Burmese Tenasserim , a British zone . Arrangements were also made to allay the rivalry between British and French colonists in the New Hebrides .",

    "context": "The Sistine Chapel ( / ˌsɪstiːn ˈtʃæpəl / ; Latin : Sacellum Sixtinum ; Italian : Cappella Sistina ( kapˈpɛlla siˈstiːna ) ) is a chapel in the Apostolic Palace , the official residence of the Pope , in Vatican City . Originally known as the Cappella Magna , the chapel takes its name from Pope Sixtus IV , who restored it between 1477 and 1480 . Since that time , the chapel has served as a place of both religious and functionary papal activity . Today it is the site of the Papal conclave , the process by which a new pope is selected . The fame of the Sistine Chapel lies mainly in the frescos that decorate the interior , and most particularly the Sistine Chapel ceiling and The Last Judgment by Michelangelo . During the reign of Sixtus IV , a team of Renaissance painters that included Sandro Botticelli , Pietro Perugino , Pinturicchio , Domenico Ghirlandaio and Cosimo Rosselli , created a series of frescos depicting the Life of Moses and the Life of Christ , offset by papal portraits above and trompe l'oeil drapery below . These paintings were completed in 1482 , and on 15 August 1483 Sixtus IV celebrated the first mass in the Sistine Chapel for the Feast of the Assumption , at which ceremony the chapel was consecrated and dedicated to the Virgin Mary .",

    "question": "where was twilight breaking dawn part 1 filmed",
    "context": "Godfrey considered releasing the second film in 3D to differentiate between the time before and after Bella becomes a vampire , an idea originally proposed for Eclipse , but said that the decision is up to Condon . However , he said that if the second film were to be released in 3D , he would like to shoot it with the proper equipment in `` real '' 3D as was done with Avatar ( 2009 ) , not convert it into 3D in post-production as was done with Clash of the Titans ( 2010 ) . In order to keep the budget on both parts of Breaking Dawn reasonable , even though it is substantially greater than the previous installments in the series , much of the film was shot in and around Baton Rouge , Louisiana and Celtic Studios in Baton Rouge . Shooting in Louisiana provided larger tax credits , which a small studio like Summit Entertainment would find favorable . Summit announced in a press release on July 9 , 2010 , that filming was to take place in Baton Rouge , Ucluelet and Vancouver , with the wedding being shot in Squamish . ( Also shot in near by Pemberton , British Columbia ) . Both parts will be shot back - to - back as one project . The film will attempt to keep its PG - 13 rating , and it will not feature any of the gruesome scenes from the novel with Kristen Stewart confirming that the birth scene was n't as grotesque as described in the book and that she did n't `` puke up blood '' , though director Bill Condon said that they shot everything as `` powerful and potent as they could '' . Though there were many reports of the cast in Whistler , British Columbia , none of the actual filming took place in Whistler itself , but to the north and south of the town in nearby Pemberton ( north ) & Squamish ( south ) . The Stars were housed in Whistler at 4 and 5 star hotels , the crew in Squamish & Pemberton . Filming officially began on November 1 , 2010 in Brazil , with locations in Rio de Janeiro and Paraty , Rio de Janeiro . The first scenes were shot in the Lapa District in Rio de Janeiro for one night . A long city block was rented for shooting , and Summit Entertainment paid residents 50 to 500 reais ( 30 to 300 in American dollars ) to not allow paparazzi or fans to overlook filming from their windows . Moreover , owners of bars and restaurants were paid 10,000 and 20,000 reais ( 6,000 to 12,000 in American dollars ) to stay closed for the evening to eliminate noise and provide a clear street .",

    "question": "where did they film descendants of the sun",
    "context": "Initially , there were doubts about the profitability of the drama , as a story involving a soldier may not be enough to garner a very high successive rate . This is revealed when SBS were reluctant to continue with the project . It was then passed to KBS . According to local reports by Newsis , lead actor Song Joong - ki was not the first choice of writers and directors for the hit South Korean series , as he was deemed too slender for the role of a heroic special forces officer . Song was later cast as the producers decided to change the character of the role . The 6 June episode of tvN 's The List 2016 revealed the names of four actors who rejected the role before Joong - ki was chosen . As per the show , the A-listers who passed the role includes Won Bin , Jo In - sung , Gong Yoo , and Kim Woo - bin . Reportedly , the actors were sceptical on sporting the army style short hair . It is also said that the artists expressed slight discomfort on portraying a role of a soldier and could not commit with the pre-production format of the show . On June 12 , 2015 , lead actors Song Joong - ki and Song Hye - kyo filmed their first scene in Seoul . On September 28 , 2015 , the entire cast and crew ( including the four leads , Song Joong - ki , Song Hye - kyo , Jin Goo , Kim Ji - won , as well as supporting actors Kang Shin - il and Onew ) departed for Greece . The team resided in the country for approximately a month to shoot episodes crucial to the drama 's plot . According to Greek and South Korean news portals and blogs , filming mainly took place in Zakynthos , Arachova , Lemnos , and Navagio . The series ' location was modelled after Iraq , a remote area located at the margin of Balkan Peninsula ; but changed its name to Uruk to avoid diplomatic conflict . On November 25 , 2015 , it was announced that actor Song Joong - ki injured his arm while filming an action scene for the drama on November 23 . On December 7 , 2015 , Song Joong - ki returned to work only 2 weeks after he was injured and spotted filming at a station in Seoul . The MERS - CoV outbreak in South Korea in 2015 also seriously hampered filming schedules . The outbreak claimed the lives of 33 people , according to WHO .",

It `` set off France 's own fiscal crisis , in which a political brawl over taxation soon became one of the reasons for the French Revolution . '' France obtained its revenge against Britain by assisting the Americans ; however , it gained little real value and her massive debt severely weakened the government and escalated it towards the French Revolution . The French objective in assisting the Americans was to weaken Britain and to seek revenge for the defeat in the Seven Years ' War . In 1777 , America captured the British invasion army at Saratoga . In 1778 , France recognized the United States of America as a sovereign nation , signed a military alliance , and went to war with Britain . France built coalitions with the Netherlands and Spain , provided Americans with grants , weapons and loans , sent a combat army to serve under George Washington , and provided a navy that prevented the second British army from escaping Yorktown in 1781 . Benjamin Franklin served as the American ambassador to France from 1776 to 1785 and he met with many leading diplomats , aristocrats , intellectuals , scientists and financiers .

The Creature was played by Ben Chapman on land and by Ricou Browning underwater . The film premiered in Detroit on February 12 and was released on a regional basis , opening on various dates . Creature from the Black Lagoon was filmed in 3D and originally projected by the polarized light method . The audience wore viewers with gray polarizing filters , similar to the viewers most commonly used today . Because the brief 1950s 3D film fad had peaked in mid-1953 and was fading fast in early 1954 , many audiences actually saw the film `` flat '' , in 2D . Typically , the film was shown in 3D in large downtown theaters and flat in smaller neighborhood theaters . In 1975 Creature from the Black Lagoon was re-released to theaters in the inferior red - and - blue - glasses anaglyph 3D format , which was also used for a 1980 home video release on Beta and VHS videocassettes .",

    "question": "where did the lord's prayer originate from",
    "context": "Two versions of this prayer are recorded in the gospels : a longer form within the Sermon on the Mount in the Gospel of Matthew , and a shorter form in the Gospel of Luke when `` one of his disciples said to him , ' Lord , teach us to pray , as John taught his disciples . ' '' Lutheran theologian Harold Buls suggested that both were original , the Matthaen version spoken by Jesus early in his ministry in Galilee , and the Lucan version one year later , `` very likely in Judea '' . The first three of the seven petitions in Matthew address God ; the other four are related to human needs and concerns . The Matthew account alone includes the `` Your will be done '' and the `` Rescue us from the evil one '' ( or `` Deliver us from evil '' ) petitions . Both original Greek texts contain the adjective epiousios , which does not appear in any other classical or Koine Greek literature ; while controversial , `` daily '' has been the most common English - language translation of this word . Some Christians , particularly Protestants , conclude the prayer with a doxology , a later addendum appearing in some manuscripts of Matthew .",

    "question": "who were the 2 presidents to get impeached",
    "context": "Impeachment in the United States is an enumerated power of the legislature that allows formal charges to be brought against a civil officer of government for crimes alleged to have been committed . Most impeachments have concerned alleged crimes committed while in office , though there have been a few cases in which Congress has impeached and convicted officials partly for prior crimes . The actual trial on such charges , and subsequent removal of an official upon conviction , is separate from the act of impeachment itself . Impeachment proceedings have been initiated against several presidents of the United States . Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton are the only two presidents to have been successfully impeached by the House of Representatives , and both were later acquitted by the Senate . The impeachment process against Richard Nixon was never completed , as Nixon resigned his office before the vote of the full House for impeachment , but such a vote was widely expected to pass , and the threat of it and a subsequent conviction in the Senate was the impetus for Nixon 's departure . To date , no president has been removed from office by impeachment and conviction . The impeached official continues in office until conviction . Impeachment is analogous to indictment in regular court proceedings ; trial by the other house is analogous to the trial before judge and jury in regular courts . Typically , the lower house of the legislature impeaches the official and the upper house conducts the trial .",

    "question": "who described the basic mechanism of steam reaction",
    "context": "Because the turbine generates rotary motion , it is particularly suited to be used to drive an electrical generator -- about 90 % of all electricity generation in the United States in the year 1996 was by use of steam turbines . The steam turbine is a form of heat engine that derives much of its improvement in thermodynamic efficiency from the use of multiple stages in the expansion of the steam , which results in a closer approach to the ideal reversible expansion process . The first device that may be classified as a reaction steam turbine was little more than a toy , the classic Aeolipile , described in the 1st century by Hero of Alexandria in Roman Egypt . In 1551 , Taqi al - Din in Ottoman Egypt described a steam turbine with the practical application of rotating a spit . Steam turbines were also described by the Italian Giovanni Branca ( 1629 ) and John Wilkins in England ( 1648 ) . The devices described by Taqi al - Din and Wilkins are today known as steam jacks . In 1672 an impulse steam turbine driven car was designed by Ferdinand Verbiest . A more modern version of this car was produced some time in the late 18th century by an unknown German mechanic . In 1775 at Soho James Watt designed a reaction turbine that was put to work there . In 1827 the Frenchmen Real and Pichon patented and constructed a compound impulse turbine . The modern steam turbine was invented in 1884 by Sir Charles Parsons , whose first model was connected to a dynamo that generated 7.5 kW ( 10 hp ) of electricity . The invention of Parsons ' steam turbine made cheap and plentiful electricity possible and revolutionized marine transport and naval warfare . Parsons ' design was a reaction type . His patent was licensed and the turbine scaled - up shortly after by an American , George Westinghouse . The Parsons turbine also turned out to be easy to scale up . Parsons had the satisfaction of seeing his invention adopted for all major world power stations , and the size of generators had increased from his first 7.5 kW set up to units of 50,000 kW capacity . Within Parson 's lifetime , the generating capacity of a unit was scaled up by about 10,000 times , and the total output from turbo - generators constructed by his firm C.A. Parsons and Company and by their licensees , for land purposes alone , had exceeded thirty million horse - power .",

    "question": "what are the three membranes that make up the meninges",
    "context": "The meninges ( / məˈnɪndʒiːz / , singular : meninx ( / ˈmiːnɪŋks / or / ˈmɛnɪŋks / ) , from Ancient Greek : μῆνιγξ , translit . mēninx , lit . ' membrane ' , adjectival : meningeal / məˈnɪndʒəl / ) are the three membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord . In mammals , the meninges are the dura mater , the arachnoid mater , and the pia mater . Cerebrospinal fluid is located in the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater . The primary function of the meninges is to protect the central nervous system . The dura mater ( Latin : tough mother ) ( also rarely called meninx fibrosa or pachymeninx ) is a thick , durable membrane , closest to the skull and vertebrae . The dura mater , the outermost part , is a loosely arranged , fibroelastic layer of cells , characterized by multiple interdigitating cell processes , no extracellular collagen , and significant extracellular spaces . The middle region is a mostly fibrous portion . It consists of two layers : the endosteal layer , which lies closest to the calvaria ( skullcap ) , and the inner meningeal layer , which lies closer to the brain . It contains larger blood vessels that split into the capillaries in the pia mater . It is composed of dense fibrous tissue , and its inner surface is covered by flattened cells like those present on the surfaces of the pia mater and arachnoid mater . The dura mater is a sac that envelops the arachnoid mater and surrounds and supports the large dural sinuses carrying blood from the brain toward the heart .",

    "context": "The Ark of the Covenant ( Hebrew : אָרוֹן הַבְּרִית ‬ , Modern Arōn Ha'brēt , Tiberian ʾĀrôn Habbərîṯ ) , also known as the Ark of the Testimony , is a gold - covered wooden chest with lid cover described in the Book of Exodus as containing the two stone tablets of the Ten Commandments . According to various texts within the Hebrew Bible , it also contained Aaron 's rod and a pot of manna . Hebrews 9 : 4 describes : `` The ark of the covenant ( was ) covered on all sides with gold , in which was a golden jar holding the manna , and Aaron 's rod which budded , and the tables of the covenant . '' The biblical account relates that , approximately one year after the Israelites ' exodus from Egypt , the Ark was created according to the pattern given to Moses by God when the Israelites were encamped at the foot of biblical Mount Sinai . Thereafter , the gold - plated acacia chest was carried by its staves while en route by the Levites approximately 2,000 cubits ( approximately 800 meters or 2,600 feet ) in advance of the people when on the march or before the Israelite army , the host of fighting men . When carried , the Ark was always hidden under a large veil made of skins and blue cloth , always carefully concealed , even from the eyes of the priests and the Levites who carried it . God was said to have spoken with Moses `` from between the two cherubim '' on the Ark 's cover . When at rest the tabernacle was set up and the holy Ark was placed under the veil of the covering , the staves of it crossing the middle side bars to hold it up off the ground .",

    "question": "what were the main types of glass first made",
    "context": "Naturally occurring glass , especially the volcanic glass obsidian , has been used by many Stone Age societies across the globe for the production of sharp cutting tools and , due to its limited source areas , was extensively traded . But in general , archaeological evidence suggests that the first true glass was made in coastal north Syria , Mesopotamia or ancient Egypt . Because of Egypt 's favorable environment for preservation , the majority of well - studied early glass is found there , although some of this is likely to have been imported . The earliest known glass objects , of the mid third millennium BC , were beads , perhaps initially created as accidental by - products of metal - working ( slags ) or during the production of faience , a pre-glass vitreous material made by a process similar to glazing . During the Late Bronze Age in Egypt ( e.g. , the Ahhotep `` Treasure '' ) and Western Asia ( e.g. Megiddo ) there was a rapid growth in glass - making technology . Archaeological finds from this period include colored glass ingots , vessels ( often colored and shaped in imitation of highly prized hardstone carvings in semi-precious stones ) and the ubiquitous beads . The alkali of Syrian and Egyptian glass was soda ash , sodium carbonate , which can be extracted from the ashes of many plants , notably halophile seashore plants : ( see saltwort ) . The earliest vessels were ' core - formed ' , produced by winding a ductile rope of glass round a shaped core of sand and clay over a metal rod , then fusing it with repeated reheatings . Threads of thin glass of different colors made with admixtures of oxides were subsequently wound around these to create patterns , which could be drawn into festoons by using metal raking tools . The vessel would then be rolled smooth ( ' marvered ' ) on a slab in order to press the decorative threads into its body . Handles and feet were applied separately . The rod was subsequently allowed to cool as the glass slowly annealed and was eventually removed from the center of the vessel , after which the core material was scraped out . Glass shapes for inlays were also often created in moulds . Much early glass production , however , relied on grinding techniques borrowed from stone working . This meant that the glass was ground and carved in a cold state .",

    "question": "where did most new england colonists come from",
    "context": "In 1614 , Dutch explorer Adriaen Block traveled along the coast of Long Island Sound and then up the Connecticut River to Hartford , Connecticut . By 1623 , the Dutch West India Company regularly traded for furs there , and they eventually fortified it for protection from the Pequot Indians and named the site `` House of Hope '' ( also identified as `` Fort Hoop , '' `` Good Hope , '' and `` Hope '' ) . A group of Puritans known as the Pilgrims arrived on the Mayflower from England and the Netherlands to establish Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts , the second successful English colony in North America following Jamestown , Virginia . About half of the one hundred - plus passengers on the Mayflower died that first winter , mostly because of diseases contracted on the voyage followed by a harsh winter . In 1621 , an American Indian named Squanto taught the colonists how to grow corn and where to catch eels and fish . His assistance was invaluable and helped them to survive the early years of the colonization . The Pilgrims lived on the same site where Squanto 's Patuxet tribe had established a village before they were wiped out from diseases . The Plymouth settlement faced great hardships and earned few profits , but it enjoyed a positive reputation in England and may have sown the seeds for further immigration . Edward Winslow and William Bradford published an account of their experiences called Mourt 's Relation ( 1622 ) . This book was only a small glimpse of the hardships and dangers encountered by the Pilgrims , but it encouraged other Puritans to immigrate during the Great Migration .",

    "context": "New York City encompasses five different county - level administrative divisions called boroughs : Manhattan , the Bronx , Queens , Brooklyn , and Staten Island . All boroughs are part of New York City , and each of the boroughs is coextensive with a respective county , the primary administrative subdivision within New York State . The Bronx and Queens are concurrent with the counties of the same name , while Manhattan , Brooklyn , and Staten Island correspond to New York , Kings , and Richmond Counties respectively . Boroughs have existed since the consolidation of the city in 1898 , when the city and each borough assumed their current boundaries . However , the boroughs have not always been coextensive with their respective counties . Before 1914 , the borough of The Bronx had been earlier in the southern part of Westchester County which had then been annexed to New York County in two stages in 1874 and 1895 -- finally , in 1914 the county was created to match the borough . Before 1899 , the County of Queens included an eastern part , which was split - off during the consolidation to become Nassau County .",

The Coast Guard is a maritime , military , multi-mission service unique among the U.S. military branches for having a maritime law enforcement mission ( with jurisdiction in both domestic and international waters ) and a federal regulatory agency mission as part of its mission set . It operates under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during peacetime , and can be transferred to the U.S. Department of the Navy by the U.S. President at any time , or by the U.S. Congress during times of war . This has happened twice , in 1917 , during World War I , and in 1941 , during World War II . Created by Congress on 4 August 1790 at the request of Alexander Hamilton as the Revenue Marine , it is the oldest continuous seagoing service of the United States . As Secretary of the Treasury , Hamilton headed the Revenue Marine , whose original purpose was collecting customs duties in the nation 's seaports .

    "question": "what supplies the energy for most of the microorganisms in the rhizosphere",
    "context": "Predation is considered to be top - down because these interactions decrease the population , but the closeness of the interactions of species directly effects the availability of resources causing the population to also be affected by bottom - up controls . Without soil fauna , microbes that directly prey upon competitors of plants and plant mutualists , interactions within the rhizosphere would be antagonistic toward the plants . Soil fauna provide the top - down component of the rhizosphere while also allowing for the bottom - up increase in nutrients from rhizodeposition and inorganic nitrogen . The complexity of these interactions have also been shown through experiments with common soil fauna , such as nematodes and protists . Predation by bacterial - feeding nematodes was shown to influence nitrogen availability and plant growth . There was also an increase in the populations of bacteria in which nematodes were added . Predation upon Pseduomonas by amoeba shows predators are able to upregulate toxins produced by prey without direct interaction using supernatant . The ability of predators to control the expression and production of biocontrol agents in prey without direct contact is related to the evolution of prey species to signals of high predator density and nutrient availability . The food web in the rhizosphere can be considered as three different channels with two different sources of energy ; the detritus - dependent channels are fungi and bacterial species and the root energy dependent channel consists of nematodes , symbiotic species , and some arthropods . This food web is constantly in flux as the amount of detrius available and the rate of root sloughing changes as roots grow and age . This bacterial channel is considered to be a faster channel because of the ability of species to focus on more accessible resources in the rhizosphere and have faster regeneration times compared with the fungal channel . All three of these channels are also interrelated to the roots that form the base of the rhizosphere ecosystem and the predators , such as the nematodes and protists , that prey upon many of the same species of mircroflora .

    "context": "According to Jewish tradition , God inscribes each person 's fate for the coming year into a book , the Book of Life , on Rosh Hashanah , and waits until Yom Kippur to `` seal '' the verdict . During the Days of Awe , a Jew tries to amend his or her behavior and seek forgiveness for wrongs done against God ( bein adam leMakom ) and against other human beings ( bein adam lechavero ) . The evening and day of Yom Kippur are set aside for public and private petitions and confessions of guilt ( Vidui ) . At the end of Yom Kippur , one hopes that they have been forgiven by God . The Yom Kippur prayer service includes several unique aspects . One is the actual number of prayer services . Unlike a regular day , which has three prayer services ( Ma'ariv , the evening prayer ; Shacharit , the morning prayer ; and Mincha , the afternoon prayer ) , or a Shabbat or Yom Tov , which have four prayer services ( Ma'ariv ; Shacharit ; Mussaf , the additional prayer ; and Mincha ) , Yom Kippur has five prayer services ( Ma'ariv ; Shacharit ; Musaf ; Mincha ; and Ne'ilah , the closing prayer ) . The prayer services also include private and public confessions of sins ( Vidui ) and a unique prayer dedicated to the special Yom Kippur avodah ( service ) of the Kohen Gadol ( high priest ) in the Holy Temple in Jerusalem . As one of the most culturally significant Jewish holidays , Yom Kippur is observed by many secular Jews who may not observe other holidays . Many secular Jews attend synagogue on Yom Kippur -- for many secular Jews the High Holy Days are the only times of the year during which they attend synagogue -- causing synagogue attendance to soar .",

The meaning of the term `` Camino Real '' has in fact changed over time . In earlier Spanish colonial times , any road under the direct jurisdiction of the Spanish crown and its viceroys was considered to be a camino real . Examples of such roads ran between principal settlements throughout Spain and its colonies such as New Spain . Most caminos reales had names apart from the appended camino real . Once Mexico won its independence from Spain , no road in Mexico , including California , was a camino real . The name was rarely used after that and was only revived in the American period in connection with the boosterism associated with the Mission Revival movement of the early 20th century .",

    "question": "who hits the fastest century in t 20 international cricket",
    "context": "A Twenty20 International ( T20I ) is an international cricket match between two teams , each having T20I status , as determined by the International Cricket Council . In a T20I , the two teams play a single innings each , which is restricted to a maximum of 20 overs . The format was originally introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board for the county cricket competition with the first matches contested on 13 June 2003 between the English counties in the Twenty20 Cup . The first T20I took place on 17 February 2005 when Australia defeated New Zealand by 44 runs at Eden Park in Auckland , with Australian captain Ricky Ponting finishing not out on 98 . A century is a score of one hundred or more runs by a batsman in a single innings . This is regarded as a notable achievement . The first century in a T20I match was scored by Chris Gayle of the West Indies who made 117 against South Africa at the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 in 2007 . South Africa won the match , one of only seven occurrences which did not result in a victory to the team with the player scoring the century . The most recent century was scored by Martin Guptill of New Zealand against Australia during the 2017 -- 18 Trans - Tasman Tri-Series . New Zealand 's Colin Munro leads the list with three T20I centuries , followed by his compatriot Brendon McCullum , Gayle , West Indies ' Evin Lewis , India 's Rohit Sharma , Australia 's Glenn Maxwell and Guptill with two each . Lewis ' first century came during the 2016 series against India at the Central Broward Regional Park in Lauderhill , Florida . In reply , India 's K.L. Rahul finished on 110 not out , the only occasion where two T20I centuries were scored in the same match . Rahul 's innings is one of the eight instances where a batsman scored a century in the second innings of a T20I match . In August 2013 , Australia 's Aaron Finch posted the highest score in a T20I match with 156 while Rohit Sharma and David Miller of South Africa share the record for the fastest century , both reaching the milestone from 35 deliveries . Miller was also the first player to score a T20I century batting at number five or lower . As of February 2018 , 32 centuries have been scored by 24 different players from 649 T20I matches . Players from all teams that have permanent T20I status -- with the exception of Zimbabwe and Ireland -- have made centuries and of the teams that have temporary T20I status only Scotland , Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates have had a player reach triple figures . No players from teams that have previously held temporary T20I status have scored centuries , with Hiral Patel from Canada coming the closest with 88 not out against Ireland in 2010 . New Zealand lead the list with seven centuries , followed by Australia , India , South Africa and the West Indies with four . Centuries have been scored at 26 different grounds , with Pallekele International Cricket Stadium in Kandy , Sri Lanka , leading the list with three .",

Firstly , and especially in the United States , Canada and Ireland , they may refer to an unidentified person , or a party in a legal action whose identity is being withheld officially . In the context of law enforcement in the United States , such names are often used to refer to a corpse whose identity is unknown or unconfirmed . Secondly , such names are also often used to refer to a hypothetical `` everyman '' in other contexts , in a manner similar to `` John Q. Public '' or `` Joe Public '' . In other English - speaking countries , unique placeholder names , numbers and / or codenames have become more often used in the context of police investigations . This has included the United Kingdom , where usage of `` John Doe '' originated during the Middle Ages . However , the legal term John Doe injunction ( or John Doe Order ) , has survived in English law and other legal systems influenced by it . Other names used informally such as `` Joe Bloggs '' or `` John Smith '' have sometimes been informally used as placeholders for an everyman in the UK , Australia and New Zealand , such names are seldom used in legal or police circles in the same sense as John Doe .",

Three Marines in the photograph , Sergeant Michael Strank , Corporal Harlon Block ( misidentified as Sergeant Hank Hansen until January 1947 ) , and Private First Class Franklin Sousley were killed in action over the next few days . The other three surviving flag - raisers in the photograph were Corporals ( then Private First Class ) Rene Gagnon , Ira Hayes , and Harold Schultz ( misidentified as PhM2c . John Bradley until June 2016 ) . Both men originally misidentified as flag raisers had helped raise a smaller flag about 90 minutes earlier , and were both still on the mountaintop and witnessed -- but were not part of -- the specific moment of raising the larger flag that was captured in the Pulitzer Prize - winning photo . The image was later used by Felix de Weldon to sculpt the Marine Corps War Memorial , which was dedicated in 1954 to all Marines who died for their country and is located in Arlington Ridge Park , near the Ord - Weitzel Gate to Arlington National Cemetery and the Netherlands Carillon .",

At the end of The Third Wheel , Rowley begins dating Abigail Brown , a girl who was originally Greg 's date for the Valentine 's Day dance . This plot continues in Diary of a Wimpy Kid : Hard Luck , where he ditches Greg for his new girlfriend Abigail . At the end of the book , the couple break up and he becomes friends with Greg again . Rowley has what Greg considers strange interests for his age and gender , such as liking a singer for `` six - year - old girls '' named Joshie and action figures Greg believes are for younger kids . Rowley is also the owner of the comic strip Zoo Wee Mama . Rowley claims that Greg had nothing to do with the comic strip in the first book , a rare antagonistic move from him .

Thanksgiving has been celebrated nationally on and off since 1789 , after Congress requested a proclamation by George Washington . It has been celebrated as a federal holiday every year since 1864 , when , during the American Civil War , President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a national day of `` Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens , '' to be celebrated on the last Thursday in November . Together with Christmas and the New Year , Thanksgiving is a part of the broader holiday season . The event that Americans commonly call the `` First Thanksgiving '' was celebrated by the Pilgrims after their first harvest in the New World in October 1621 . This feast lasted three days , and -- as accounted by attendee Edward Winslow -- it was attended by 90 Native Americans and 53 Pilgrims . The New England colonists were accustomed to regularly celebrating `` thanksgivings '' -- days of prayer thanking God for blessings such as military victory or the end of a drought .",

The Court 's hearings are open to the public except for certain sensitive cases where a sealing order is enacted . There are three rows of benches reserved for public seating , which are generally taken on a first - come , first - served basis except where it is reserved by counsel or parties in the appeal . Initially , all civil and criminal cases had the right to appeal to the Supreme Court . An amendment to the Supreme Court Act in 1975 required that parties wishing to appeal must apply for `` leave to appeal '' . The only exception is a select type of more serious criminal cases where there continues to an appeal `` as of right '' , as well as appeals from reference questions submitted to the provincial courts of appeal by the provincial governments . The federal government also has the power to pose a reference to the Court on its own motion , as an original proceeding , without requiring leave from the Court . Leave applications are considered by the justices in groups of three . Only cases which raise questions of public importance are granted . The reasons for their decisions on leave applications are not given .",

    "context": "The Grand Seduction is based on the 2003 film Seducing Doctor Lewis ( original French title La grande séduction ) . Shortly after it came out at Sundance Film Festival , an English - speaking version of the film was recommended . South Korea , Spain and Canada were all interested in doing a remake but only Canada , France and Italy ultimately developed remakes . Initially , Michael Dowse was to direct the film but he dropped out due to `` artistic differences '' with producer Roger Frappier . Ken Scott , who wrote the original script , was then attached at the direction of the film . He and Frappier planned the remake to be 80 per cent the same as the original . The film was expected to start shooting on 28 August 2011 , but it got delayed . In April 2012 , Scott left the project to focus on the remaking of his Starbuck film . In May 2012 , Don McKellar came on board as director . In 2011 , there had been talks to have Robin Williams in the film but scheduling conflicts got in the way . Taylor Kitsch 's and Brendan Gleeson 's participation was confirmed in July 2012 . Set in the fictional harbour of Tickle Head , principal photography started on 30 July 2012 in St. John 's , Newfoundland and Labrador .

    "question": "who started the school of american ballet and the new york city ballet",
    "context": "The School of American Ballet ( SAB ) is an American classical ballet school and is the associate school of the New York City Ballet , a ballet company based at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City . The school trains students from the age of six , with professional vocational ballet training for students aged 11 -- 18 . Graduates of the school achieve employment with leading ballet companies worldwide , most notably in the United States with New York City Ballet , American Ballet Theatre , Boston Ballet , and San Francisco Ballet . The school was founded by the renowned Russo - Georgian - born choreographer George Balanchine , and philanthropists Lincoln Kirstein and Edward Warburg in 1934 . Balanchine 's self - prescribed edict , `` But first , a school '' , is indicative of his adherence to the ideals of the training that was fostered by the Imperial Ballet School where he received his training . He realized that most great dance companies were fed by an academy closely associated with it . This practice afforded scores of dancers , well versed in the specifics of his technique and choreographic style . Among the teachers there were many Russian emigres who fled the Russian Revolution : Pierre Vladimiroff , Felia Doubrovska , Anatole Oboukhoff , Hélène Dudin , Ludmilla Schollar , Antonina Tumkovsky , and Alexandra Danilova . Their intention was to establish a major classical ballet company in America , which would lead to the formation of today 's New York City Ballet . The school was formed to train and feed dancers into the company . It opened at 637 Madison Avenue with 32 students on January 2 , 1934 , and the students first performed that June . Seventy - five years later , the School was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Barack Obama . Students are chosen through audition . Children 's division auditions for the 2007 - 08 school year included six - year - olds for the first time ; previously , the youngest students were required to turn eight in the year they began their studies . Children in the younger divisions are able to perform in various ballets with the company including George Balanchine 's famous The Nutcracker , A Midsummer Night 's Dream , Peter Martins 's Swan Lake , and The Sleeping Beauty . The most advanced students perform in a workshop at the end of each year where the heads of many prestigious ballet companies choose several of them to join their companies , including New York City Ballet . This started in 1965 , when Alexandra Danilova sought and received approval from Balanchine to produce a spring workshop performance for the students . These workshops have become an important preview for many outstanding dancers .",

It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is one of the eight `` hottest hot - spots '' of biological diversity in the world . It is sometimes called the Great Escarpment of India . The range runs north to south along the western edge of the Deccan Plateau , and separates the plateau from a narrow coastal plain , called Konkan , along the Arabian Sea . A total of thirty - nine properties including national parks , wildlife sanctuaries and reserve forests were designated as world heritage sites - twenty in Kerala , ten in Karnataka , five in Tamil Nadu and four in Maharashtra . The range starts near the border of Gujarat and Maharashtra , south of the Tapti river , and runs approximately 1,600 km ( 990 mi ) through the states of Maharashtra , Goa , Karnataka , Kerala and Tamil Nadu ending at Swamithoppe , near Kanyakumari , at the southern tip of India . These hills cover 160,000 km ( 62,000 sq mi ) and form the catchment area for complex riverine drainage systems that drain almost 40 % of India .

    "question": "who introduced four c mode 1 of creativity",
    "context": "The formal psychometric measurement of creativity , from the standpoint of orthodox psychological literature , is usually considered to have begun with J.P. Guilford 's 1950 address to the American Psychological Association , which helped popularize the topic and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity . ( It should be noted that the London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as 1927 with the work of H.L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination , but it did not have the same impact . ) Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity ( as measured ) as a separate aspect of human cognition to IQ - type intelligence , into which it had previously been subsumed . Guilford 's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ , the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down . James C. Kaufman and Beghetto introduced a `` four C '' model of creativity ; mini-c ( `` transformative learning '' involving `` personally meaningful interpretations of experiences , actions , and insights '' ) , little - c ( everyday problem solving and creative expression ) , Pro-C ( exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent ) and Big - C ( creativity considered great in the given field ) . This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity . It also , the authors argued , made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals . The contrast of terms `` Big C '' and `` Little c '' has been widely used . Kozbelt , Beghetto and Runco use a little - c / Big - C model to review major theories of creativity . Margaret Boden distinguishes between h - creativity ( historical ) and p - creativity ( personal ) .",

The number seven was chosen because the Greeks believed it represented perfection and plenty , and because it was the number of the five planets known anciently , plus the sun and moon . Many similar lists have been made . The historian Herodotus ( 484 -- ca . 425 BC ) and the scholar Callimachus of Cyrene ( ca . 305 -- 240 BC ) , at the Museum of Alexandria , made early lists of seven wonders .

It was first issued as a double A-side single with `` Day Tripper '' in December 1965 . The release marked the first time in Britain that both tracks on an artist 's single were promoted as joint A-sides . The song was recorded during the sessions for the band 's Rubber Soul album . The single was number 1 in Britain ( where it won the Ivor Novello Award for the top - selling A-side of 1965 ) , America , Australia , Canada and Ireland . `` We Can Work It Out '' is a comparatively rare example of a Lennon -- McCartney collaboration from this period in the Beatles ' career , in that it recalls the level of collaboration the two songwriters had shared when writing the group 's hit singles of 1963 . This song , `` A Day in the Life '' , `` Baby , You 're a Rich Man '' and `` I 've Got a Feeling '' , are among the notable exceptions .",

    "context": "The term has become popular among historians and journalists , such as Charles C. Mann , whose book 1493 expands and updates Crosby 's original research . Several plants native to the Americas have spread around the world , including Potato , maize , tomato , and tobacco . Before 1500 , potatoes were not grown outside of South America . By the 1840s , Ireland was so dependent on the potato that the proximate cause of the Great Famine was a potato disease . Potatoes eventually became an important staple of the diet in much of Europe , contributing to about 25 % of the population growth in Afro - Eurasia between 1700 and 1900 . Many European rulers , including Frederick the Great of Prussia and Catherine the Great of Russia , encouraged the cultivation of the potato . Maize and cassava , introduced by the Portuguese from South America in the 16th century , have replaced sorghum and millet as Africa 's most important food crops . 16th - century Spanish colonizers introduced new staple crops to Asia from the Americas , including maize and sweet potatoes , and thereby contributed to population growth in Asia . On a larger scale , the coming of potatoes and maize to the old world `` resulted in caloric and nutritional improvements over previously existing staples '' throughout the Eurasian landmass as they created more varied and abundant food production .",

    "question": "who is required to file a flight plan",
    "context": "Flight plans are documents filed by a pilot or flight dispatcher with the local Civil Aviation Authority ( e.g. the FAA in the United States ) prior to departure which indicate the plane 's planned route or flight path . Flight plan format is specified in ICAO Doc 4444 . They generally include basic information such as departure and arrival points , estimated time en route , alternate airports in case of bad weather , type of flight ( whether instrument flight rules ( IFR ) or visual flight rules ( VFR ) ) , the pilot 's information , number of people on board and information about the aircraft itself . In most countries , flight plans are required for flights under IFR , but may be optional for flying VFR unless crossing international borders . Flight plans are highly recommended , especially when flying over inhospitable areas , such as water , as they provide a way of alerting rescuers if the flight is overdue . In the United States and Canada , when an aircraft is crossing the Air Defense Identification Zone ( ADIZ ) , either an IFR or a special type of VFR flight plan called a DVFR ( Defense VFR ) flight plan must be filed . For IFR flights , flight plans are used by air traffic control to initiate tracking and routing services . For VFR flights , their only purpose is to provide needed information should search and rescue operations be required , or for use by air traffic control when flying in a `` Special Flight Rules Area '' . Routing types used in flight planning are : airway , navaid and direct . A route may be composed of segments of different routing types . For example , a route from Chicago to Rome may include airway routing over the U.S. and Europe , but direct routing over the Atlantic Ocean .",
